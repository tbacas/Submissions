 Project 3: Web APIs & Classification
Description
In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Now we're going to put those skills to the test.

For project 3, your goal is two-fold:

Using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.
About the API
Reddit's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from /r/boardgames, all I have to do is add .json to the end of the url: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames.json

To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use Reddit's API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y3ZE26Ciuk
