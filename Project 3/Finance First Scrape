11,Desperately need PSLF advice (law - public service loan forgiveness),"I graduated law school in May. My job starts in October. I’ll be working for the federal government (qualifying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness - i.e. the one where the remainder of your loans is forgiven after 10 years/120 payments and you **don’t** have to pay taxes on the forgiveness. This is **not** the same as the income based repayment program, where you have to pay taxes on the forgiven loans (although I do believe my payments are also based on income). 

I am starting out at a GS-11, making ~$68,000/year. Once I get my bar results, I’ll be bumped up to a GS-12, making ~$81,000. Over the next 10 years on the government pay scale, I anticipate my salary to increase up to around $110,000-$115,000. Throughout this time, my law school will pay off a diminishing portion of my loan for me until I reach $110,000, at which point I will be responsible for the entire monthly payment. 

**I was wondering if anyone has successfully used public service loan forgiveness (again, the one where you don’t pay tax on the forgiven amount), and would be willing to answer a few questions for me.**

**1) Is there a maximum amount in loans that can be forgiven?** (I have around $280,000 in federal loans)

**2) How do I ensure that I qualify after 120 payments?** I’ve heard some horror stories of people making their 120 payments and it not being accepted because the government lost track of their records. In terms of record keeping, what should I be doing? 

**3) Along the same vein, what are my duties/responsibilities each month?** How much will I be expected to pay based on my income? 

**4) Does it make more sense to ride out the public sector thing and get my loans forgiven, or wait a few years and transfer to the private sector and get a higher salary and just pay off the loans fully myself?** The thing is, with my government salary, I expect my interest to accrue almost as fast as I pay the loans off, so I’ll be treading water essentially for 10 years until the government forgives the debt. So even if I move over to private sector after 3 or 4 years, I’ll probably be starting off without having made a dent in the loans.

**5) If I were to transfer to the private sector, what salary would I have to be making for it to make more sense to go the private sector route rather than the public sector loan forgiveness route?**

Thank you! ",finance,1535920035,dlv9,9cf8sn,2,1,True,2018-09-02

So, at the end of the movie The Big Short, I still don't fully understand to who M. Baum and his team are selling the swaps to? I mean, at that stage, it seems like everything has already collapsed, who would want to buy it? And shouldn't the bank they bought the short position from give them their money?

This might actually just be due to my poor understanding of a short position in the first place.

17,Breaking Lease with Apartment Terror,"If anyone has any insider knowledge about apartment leasing please help. I'm moving for a job and I have to break my lease on my apartment. I had to give 2 months notice, could not sublease, and I have to forfeit my security deposit and pay an astronomical amount in fees for breaking the lease. This all adds up to be around $3000. I have lived here for 5 months and went to pay my rent today, and they slapped on a huge charge for pet rent/fee. It was $360. My cat is an emotional support animal and he is registered. I gave them all his info upon move in, but they said he doesn't count as a support animal because I don't have a doctor's note. A brief backstory: I was prescribed a cocktail of antidepressants by my doctor about 2 years ago, and they obviously made me feel like a shit zombie for over a year. When I got my cat, he really helped me and I got off the meds. Honeslty I don't know what I would do without him.  When I moved, my old doctor refused to write me a note for my cat so I could show the apartment manager. Probably because I stopped seeing her as a doctor. Every time I visited, I told her how bad the meds made me feel and she would push new medication on me all the time. I just stopped taking it and quit showing up to appointments. 

Anyway, I'm trying to pay rent but with the fee tacked on I can't afford it. I went to the office and the lady said I could talk to the manager but there is nothing they can do because it's ""policy"". I'm going to be so broke I'm literally putting all my savings into breaking this lease so I can move because of a great job opportunity in another city. Is there anything I can do? Please help. I'm willing to pay the rest of the fees for breaking my lease, but they have nickel and dimed me so much I can't afford another $360 fee. I would really appreciate some advice. I meet with the manager tomorrow morning. ",finance,1535665862,meganmeep,9bnu14,1,1,True,2018-08-30

111,How does the mortgage process work? (buying our first home),"So we are building a townhouse (where I live in Utah building new is the same price as buying preexisting) and have already started the beginning stages of the mortgage process. We submitted the last 2 months of our bank statements, W2s, tax returns for the past two years, ect... 

Our house will be ready end of September (so in a month) and we'll be coming that same time. 

**My questions is this: is our lender going to be looking at our bank account again?** Might sound like a weird question, but after we've given them our bank statements, are they going to be checking again what's happening in our account? 

Reason I ask is because my parents (super sweet people) are going to lend us (have not yet, but will) some money for about a month to help buy furniture and we're going to pay them back. But, lenders specifically ask you ""Is any of the money for the purchase of this home a loan?"" And I'm not sure if I'm lying or what if I say, ""Well, yeah maybe a very small portion might be a loan, but the rest of that money we're using for furniture, blinds, ect..."" 

Is this scenario going to raise any red flags with our lender?",finance,1535729162,atjones6,9bujup,9,1,True,2018-08-31

Question: I've never really come across a job like this where i'm working at a company 'full-time permanent' but being on a different companies payroll.

237,Desperately need PSLF advice (law - public service loan forgiveness),"I graduated law school in May. My job starts in October. I’ll be working for the federal government (qualifying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness - i.e. the one where the remainder of your loans is forgiven after 10 years/120 payments and you **don’t** have to pay taxes on the forgiveness. This is **not** the same as the income based repayment program, where you have to pay taxes on the forgiven loans (although I do believe my payments are also based on income). 

I am starting out at a GS-11, making ~$68,000/year. Once I get my bar results, I’ll be bumped up to a GS-12, making ~$81,000. Over the next 10 years on the government pay scale, I anticipate my salary to increase up to around $110,000-$115,000. Throughout this time, my law school will pay off a diminishing portion of my loan for me until I reach $110,000, at which point I will be responsible for the entire monthly payment. 

**I was wondering if anyone has successfully used public service loan forgiveness (again, the one where you don’t pay tax on the forgiven amount), and would be willing to answer a few questions for me.**

**1) Is there a maximum amount in loans that can be forgiven?** (I have around $280,000 in federal loans)

**2) How do I ensure that I qualify after 120 payments?** I’ve heard some horror stories of people making their 120 payments and it not being accepted because the government lost track of their records. In terms of record keeping, what should I be doing? 

**3) Along the same vein, what are my duties/responsibilities each month?** How much will I be expected to pay based on my income? 

**4) Does it make more sense to ride out the public sector thing and get my loans forgiven, or wait a few years and transfer to the private sector and get a higher salary and just pay off the loans fully myself?** The thing is, with my government salary, I expect my interest to accrue almost as fast as I pay the loans off, so I’ll be treading water essentially for 10 years until the government forgives the debt. So even if I move over to private sector after 3 or 4 years, I’ll probably be starting off without having made a dent in the loans.

**5) If I were to transfer to the private sector, what salary would I have to be making for it to make more sense to go the private sector route rather than the public sector loan forgiveness route?**

Will the UK have to come up with its own regulatory technical standards for PSD2 after Brexit, as a result? Or will PSD2's RTS apply even though Britain left the EU, if Britain retains PSD2 regulations?

I immediately start sorting the mail and found massive amount of medical bills from various places. I’m talking close to 10k worth of bills. I couldn’t figure out how in the world it got to be so much as we have tri-care (and I have BCBS). Currently my husband is deployed and I am unable to communicate with him on the subject. Most of the bills are from 2015/16 (my husband enlisted 2012) and we generally use out-of-network doctors as my son as a lot of specialists he needs to go to. I personally have two insurances and a few of them ran them through neither. Do I pay them off? Do I go through the debt collectors? We were planning on buying a house when he gets back and this is just heart breaking. 

To sum this up: how tf do I get these taken care as they were never ran through insurance in the first place? and what would be the best financial plan moving forward?",finance,1536020627,eiggaMAD,9cqq3n,10,1,True,2018-09-03

So, a few days ago I found a cheque from my college (bursary), for $450 CAD. It had been signed, but did not have the writing “deposited” on it, which I always write on my cheque after depositing them. (I use my mobile banking app for this). So I figured, why not try and deposit it (me thinking that if a cheque had already been cashed in that it would be declined...) the cheque went through, I got the money in my account. When I told my mom, she freaked out and said that if it had already been deposited, I could be charged with fraud. I immediately freaked out and panicked. My bank doesn’t open till tomorrow morning....what do I do?? I’m having a major panic attack!

So, at the end of the movie The Big Short, I still don't fully understand to who M. Baum and his team are selling the swaps to?

This might actually just be due to my poor understanding of a short position in the first place.

27,"quick question, why do we assume the bond price is $100?","4. A corporate bond maturing in five years is currently trading at $96.304. The coupon rate on
the bond is 10 percent and coupons are paid annually. Based on this information, the yield to
maturity on this bond is closest to:


A. 9.0%
B. 10.0%.
C. 10.5%.
D. 11.0%.
E. None of the above.


D is correct. As the face value is not given, we assume that it is $100. The price of the bonds
today is:


P0 = 96.30 = (10/rD) [1- (1/(1+rD)
5
)] + 100/(1+rD)
5
As the bonds are selling at a discount we know that the yield to maturity will be higher than
the coupon rate (why?). At 10.5%, the present value of the face value and coupon payments is
$98.129, which is higher than the market price of $96.304. So, the yield to maturity must be
11%. (You can verify that at 11% the present value of the face value and remaining coupon
payments is $96.30.)",finance,1535434029,Patiiii,9aw8zb,1,1,True,2018-08-28

I have been thinking about plastic surgery for awhile and finally came to the decision that I am going to do it. I’m giving myself a $10k budget for what I want! I’m thinking it will all be less than that, but you never really know. My DH and I will finance this together. We only have house debt and car debt. We also have a credit card with 0% interest until 2020 that we’ve been paying monthly - we could pay the CC off because it’s only $2k but we aren’t in a rush. 

My question is, is how should we go about financing this work? We have only one card each of $3k spending limit that we never ask for a balance increase on or ever use. We both have a credit score above 780. And after we pay off the surgery I think it would be ideal for us just to keep it open to do some house projects or something. Is something like a personal loan up our alley? Or maybe a credit card with a high spending limit? Who should I even go to? The company doing the surgery has finance options but like I mentioned we want to pay off the surgery amount and then use it for other things too. 

I hope this all makes sense! Thank you in advance for your help.",finance,1535479754,JRT072014,9b19jc,2,1,True,2018-08-28

206,"""Soft"" Self-Investment","Hi r/finance,

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a question about theories on personal investments in the lens of the Time Value of Money theory. I often browse r/WouldYouRather, and there are constantly questions about if you'd like to be gifted a moderate sum now or a larger sum in the future. The post that specifically triggered my question asked if you would rather have $100K now or $1M in 10 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me, $100k \*right now\* would let me invest in many lifestyle changes (such as buying a car, eating better food, overall having easier access to luxuries that could support my mental and physical health)... This added support, while draining on \*that specific\* sum's future value could greatly improve my opportunity for higher income (both with hard assets such as the car and the mobility it offers, and with soft assets such as confidence and status). My thought is that $100k today can be invested in myself, potentially allowing for a higher ROI than other investment strategies. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering if there is academic literature or discussion that deals with this line of thought, or if any of you have anything to contribute.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story medium: My husband and I purchased our 1st home in 2009 but decided end of 2016 it was time for a change &amp; more space. There weren't many homes available at the time that fit our criteria and area we wanted to live so we more or less settled in a home that was a lot bigger than what we wanted but in one of the best neighborhoods in the area. For reference, it's just husband, me and giant dog. Our home is 3000sqft and we use *maybe* 1100sqft of it. We closed on 3/17/17 and are seriously considering putting it up for sale while the market it still booming. One thing I did not think of in all of this is Capital Gains. I read through the IRS website and criteria that must be met before being excluded from CG. Obviously we have not lived in our home for more than 2yrs but we also don't plan on making $500K (filing joint) on the sale of our home. My question is, if we make around $25K on the sale (which is very likely) what kind of CG tax are we looking at? From my understanding, if we sell at a profit and immediately reinvest in another home the CG tax would not apply but I'm thinking in terms if we cannot find the right home at the time of sale of our home.

Nissan Motor Co said on August 3, 2018 it agreed to sell its electric car battery unit to Chinese renewable energy firm Envision Group for an undisclosed sum.

363,Breaking Lease with Apartment Terror,"If anyone has any insider knowledge about apartment leasing please help. I'm moving for a job and I have to break my lease on my apartment. I had to give 2 months notice, could not sublease, and I have to forfeit my security deposit and pay an astronomical amount in fees for breaking the lease. This all adds up to be around $3000. I have lived here for 5 months and went to pay my rent today, and they slapped on a huge charge for pet rent/fee. It was $360. My cat is an emotional support animal and he is registered. I gave them all his info upon move in, but they said he doesn't count as a support animal because I don't have a doctor's note. A brief backstory: I was prescribed a cocktail of antidepressants by my doctor about 2 years ago, and they obviously made me feel like a shit zombie for over a year. When I got my cat, he really helped me and I got off the meds. Honeslty I don't know what I would do without him.  When I moved, my old doctor refused to write me a note for my cat so I could show the apartment manager. Probably because I stopped seeing her as a doctor. Every time I visited, I told her how bad the meds made me feel and she would push new medication on me all the time. I just stopped taking it and quit showing up to appointments. 

Anyway, I'm trying to pay rent but with the fee tacked on I can't afford it. I went to the office and the lady said I could talk to the manager but there is nothing they can do because it's ""policy"". I'm going to be so broke I'm literally putting all my savings into breaking this lease so I can move because of a great job opportunity in another city. Is there anything I can do? Please help. I'm willing to pay the rest of the fees for breaking my lease, but they have nickel and dimed me so much I can't afford another $360 fee. I would really appreciate some advice. I meet with the manager tomorrow morning. ",finance,1535665862,meganmeep,9bnu14,1,1,True,2018-08-30

We submitted the last 2 months of our bank statements, W2s, tax returns for the past two years, ect... 

Our house will be ready end of September (so in a month) and we'll be coming that same time. 

**My questions is this: is our lender going to be looking at our bank account again?** Might sound like a weird question, but after we've given them our bank statements, are they going to be checking again what's happening in our account? 

Reason I ask is because my parents (super sweet people) are going to lend us (have not yet, but will) some money for about a month to help buy furniture and we're going to pay them back. But, lenders specifically ask you ""Is any of the money for the purchase of this home a loan?"" And I'm not sure if I'm lying or what if I say, ""Well, yeah maybe a very small portion might be a loan, but the rest of that money we're using for furniture, blinds, ect...""

Question: I've never really come across a job like this where i'm working at a company 'full-time permanent' but being on a different companies payroll.

One, they are going to want to show me pre-owned vehicles right off the bat. This is because they get paid 100% commission and can make far more off of a pre-owned car where if they sell a new $90k car they will be lucky to get $160.

Secondly So long as my credit score is a prime number (620 or more) I should have no problem getting the car I want with in reason. My score is 740 at the moment and the vehicle I am interested in is a 17' Miata MX-5 valued at $25,000 (give or take).

Obviously I want the lowest interest rate possible however, I am not sure if it would be better to go through a finance company they set me up with or if I should get a buyers order and take the order to my bank or the federal credit union.

Now he’s in the Air Force and has kept the card, at my insistence, for emergency purposes.

I am sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I also posted the same thing in r/studentloans, but I am looking for more visibility since I am in a bit of a panic. I am an American who is starting master's study in Germany this October, and I am looking to borrow around $5,000-10,000 for living expenses. While looking at some typical lenders, it appears that most German institutions (including the one I will be attending, Tübingen) are not covered. Also, in Germany, I do not qualify for any federal loans, only deferment of previous federal loans.

Can anyone point me in the right direction for attaining a small loan for graduate study abroad? It is also worth noting that getting a cosigner may not be very easy for me. Moreover, I am 28, and a British citizen (dual citizen; not a resident of Britain), if this helps at all.

234,"quick question, why do we assume the bond price is $100?","4. A corporate bond maturing in five years is currently trading at $96.304. The coupon rate on
the bond is 10 percent and coupons are paid annually. Based on this information, the yield to
maturity on this bond is closest to:


A. 9.0%
B. 10.0%.
C. 10.5%.
D. 11.0%.
E. None of the above.


D is correct. As the face value is not given, we assume that it is $100. The price of the bonds
today is:


P0 = 96.30 = (10/rD) [1- (1/(1+rD)
5
)] + 100/(1+rD)
5
As the bonds are selling at a discount we know that the yield to maturity will be higher than
the coupon rate (why?). At 10.5%, the present value of the face value and coupon payments is
$98.129, which is higher than the market price of $96.304. So, the yield to maturity must be
11%. (You can verify that at 11% the present value of the face value and remaining coupon
payments is $96.30.)",finance,1535434029,Patiiii,9aw8zb,1,1,True,2018-08-28

I have been thinking about plastic surgery for awhile and finally came to the decision that I am going to do it. I’m giving myself a $10k budget for what I want! I’m thinking it will all be less than that, but you never really know. My DH and I will finance this together. We only have house debt and car debt. We also have a credit card with 0% interest until 2020 that we’ve been paying monthly - we could pay the CC off because it’s only $2k but we aren’t in a rush. 

My question is, is how should we go about financing this work? We have only one card each of $3k spending limit that we never ask for a balance increase on or ever use. We both have a credit score above 780. And after we pay off the surgery I think it would be ideal for us just to keep it open to do some house projects or something. Is something like a personal loan up our alley? Or maybe a credit card with a high spending limit? Who should I even go to? The company doing the surgery has finance options but like I mentioned we want to pay off the surgery amount and then use it for other things too.

413,"""Soft"" Self-Investment","Hi r/finance,

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a question about theories on personal investments in the lens of the Time Value of Money theory. I often browse r/WouldYouRather, and there are constantly questions about if you'd like to be gifted a moderate sum now or a larger sum in the future. The post that specifically triggered my question asked if you would rather have $100K now or $1M in 10 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me, $100k \*right now\* would let me invest in many lifestyle changes (such as buying a car, eating better food, overall having easier access to luxuries that could support my mental and physical health)... This added support, while draining on \*that specific\* sum's future value could greatly improve my opportunity for higher income (both with hard assets such as the car and the mobility it offers, and with soft assets such as confidence and status). My thought is that $100k today can be invested in myself, potentially allowing for a higher ROI than other investment strategies. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering if there is academic literature or discussion that deals with this line of thought, or if any of you have anything to contribute. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read this!",finance,1535550990,PM_Me_Your_WorkFiles,9b9hzw,11,1,True,2018-08-29
414,Capital Gains from selling a home - clarification needed,"I posted this earlier in r/RealEstate but I was told it may be more fitting here? All help/comments are appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Long story medium: My husband and I purchased our 1st home in 2009 but decided end of 2016 it was time for a change &amp; more space. There weren't many homes available at the time that fit our criteria and area we wanted to live so we more or less settled in a home that was a lot bigger than what we wanted but in one of the best neighborhoods in the area. For reference, it's just husband, me and giant dog. Our home is 3000sqft and we use *maybe* 1100sqft of it. We closed on 3/17/17 and are seriously considering putting it up for sale while the market it still booming. One thing I did not think of in all of this is Capital Gains. I read through the IRS website and criteria that must be met before being excluded from CG. Obviously we have not lived in our home for more than 2yrs but we also don't plan on making $500K (filing joint) on the sale of our home. My question is, if we make around $25K on the sale (which is very likely) what kind of CG tax are we looking at? From my understanding, if we sell at a profit and immediately reinvest in another home the CG tax would not apply but I'm thinking in terms if we cannot find the right home at the time of sale of our home.

## Summary

Nissan Motor Co agreed to sell its electric car battery unit to Envision Group.

The Hong Kong High Court filing requests for injunction against Envision for breaching the Limited Partnership Agreement, and alleging Envision for stealing commercial secrets for the transaction with Nissan.

Envision Energy was one of the syndicated investor and limited partner of GSR's ‘AESC acquisition fund’.

Nissan Motor Co said on August 3, 2018 it agreed to sell its electric car battery unit to Chinese renewable energy firm Envision Group for an undisclosed sum.

From legal search on file, record from Hong Kong High Court this week shows a legal lawsuit by GSR Electric Vehicle Partners, L.P. against Envision Energy International Ltd.

The court filing requests for injunction against Envision for breaching the Limited Partnership Agreement, and alleging Envision for stealing commercial secrets for the transaction with Nissan.

A source close to the plaintiff told that, Envision Energy was one of the syndicated investor and limited partner of GSR's 'AESC acquisition fund', bypassed GSR Capital and contact AESC directly to make the deal.

GSR Capital has submitted summon to The High Court of Hong Kong SAR, Envision Energy International Limited facing the potential legal injunction and legal penalties over the AESC deal for breaching of Limited Partnership Agreement basic rules.

In this process, I have been working closely with some of the individuals who are assessing our business by providing them access to our financials. In doing so I became very interested in their line of work. They basically analyze Healthcare businesses to give them a valuation for acquisitions. So here are my questions:

1. How can I transition into this industry?
2. I have a MSA with a concentration in healthcare, Do I need education in other subject matter?
3. What job titles should I keep an eye out for?

I really need to take my chance and speak up but I’m really nervous. I don’t know how to bring it up. Also my mum blew my cool a few weeks ago by telling her I stalked her son on LinkedIn. But anywho she didn’t kno what LinkedIn was and asked me to come over. I was quite mad at the time because I wanted to ask in my own time when I was prepared. 

I came over and didn’t really say anything, I made it seem like I looked up the wrong person because I felt so awkward.

I want to do equities so slightly different but obviously this is closest I’ll get, I just don’t know wtf to do.

The son is always really busy but I live around the corner so I could defo meet him. Just don’t know how to get through via his mum and also WTF TO SAY OR DO :(

I would really really appreciate some help!

I’ve never networked in my life, it sounds stupid. I’ve been to networking events and just added people on LinkedIn. I always felt networking was weird I saw it as just using people but I’ve slowly learnt, in banking networking is almost key to getting where you want to ( in some cases ).

One, they are going to want to show me pre-owned vehicles right off the bat. This is because they get paid 100% commission and can make far more off of a pre-owned car where if they sell a new $90k car they will be lucky to get $160.

Secondly So long as my credit score is a prime number (620 or more) I should have no problem getting the car I want with in reason. My score is 740 at the moment and the vehicle I am interested in is a 17' Miata MX-5 valued at $25,000 (give or take).

Obviously I want the lowest interest rate possible however, I am not sure if it would be better to go through a finance company they set me up with or if I should get a buyers order and take the order to my bank or the federal credit union.

I am sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I also posted the same thing in r/studentloans, but I am looking for more visibility since I am in a bit of a panic. I am an American who is starting master's study in Germany this October, and I am looking to borrow around $5,000-10,000 for living expenses. While looking at some typical lenders, it appears that most German institutions (including the one I will be attending, Tübingen) are not covered. Also, in Germany, I do not qualify for any federal loans, only deferment of previous federal loans.

Can anyone point me in the right direction for attaining a small loan for graduate study abroad? It is also worth noting that getting a cosigner may not be very easy for me. Moreover, I am 28, and a British citizen (dual citizen; not a resident of Britain), if this helps at all.

46,Need help with letter to company,"This is a multiple part question, and I want to give it context so it makes sense and to get a good answer so I'm sorry it's long.

In not a part of any company, and have no stocks in the company I'm writing to. But I want to see it's product do well. The company is Square Enix and the product is FF TCG. If I write it a letter about what I'd like to see in the future, would they even read it? that's the first part of the quesiton is if they'd even ever see it.

Second, if a couple of my ideas included statistics about how it may profit them in doing so (I won't be specific here for time and privacy), would that come off as pretentious? Would that be saying to them that I think I'm better or that they are stupid?

Third, and perhaps most important. If I include things that their competitor Hasbro (owns Magic the Gathering, a competitor of FF TCG) has done to the detriment of their own product, as something that Square Enix said in their sales report they were attempting to do, and is something that I would caution against, would that be a weird thing to do? Mentioning a competitor of theirs in a letter, is that too much? I would be using statistics provided in Hasbros 2017 sales report in their own words. Hasbro says that the move has not worked at all is why I ask.

Not sure if this is the right place to post but here I go.

So recently I made a stock investment via a company in hong kong called Sanderson Consultants. 

I don't want to go into too much detail about my potential fuck-up but I dumped a load of money into this and I'm not sure if it's legit or not, especially as they first contacted me via a random call to my office phone.  
I got some legal looking papers which I filled in and signed but that doesn't really mean anything to me.

So, how can I make sure this is a real company and not just a phonescam?  
I checked their website but it looks kinda cheap, i.e. all the pictures seem to be the same stock image. Also tried calling them in Hong Kong, which worked.

247,why can't I have more than one (visa) bank card for the same account?,"My guesses:

1. Concerns about security.  It is ""harder"" to track the location of two cards and maybe one card might get into someone else's hands.  Why this is bullshit: I can also lose my single card. OR I could have two cards but have to activate them independently via phone / text / website.

2. This is just the way it is always been done.  One card per one account (per one name).  The system is just not setup to allow more than one card on the same account.  Why this is bullshit: tradition sucks.  This may have made sense in 1992.  It is 2019 almost.  Change it.

Why I care:

I travel.  A LOT.  In fact, I'm only in the USA maybe 1 or 2 months per year, if that.  If I lose my principal bank card, it is VERY inconvenient to get it replaced, for my principal bank, and for me.  Mailing a card overseas via overnight mail is VERY expensive, and mailing it by normal mail is unreliable or snail slow.

And here is the thing - when you are traveling it becomes much easier to lose things, misplace them , forget them, drop them, or have them stolen, by like 10x.  So it is more likely I will lose my bank card and more debilitating when I do lose it.

I'd love to be able to carry two bank cards.  One in my wallet (one on my person), and one in my travel bag (one in my room).  That way, if my wallet is lost or stolen, it is not a big deal.  I can just call and activate the backup card.  Then I can wait 1 month for a replacement secondary card to arrive by cheap mail to wherever I'm going to be.

I know I can just open another bank account - but WHY should I have to do that in 2019?

 I was really hoping for some advice with networking. A very close family friend whose son is a head director for fixed income ( something along those lines) is coming over today.

I really need to take my chance and speak up but I’m really nervous. I don’t know how to bring it up. Also my mum blew my cool a few weeks ago by telling her I stalked her son on LinkedIn. But anywho she didn’t kno what LinkedIn was and asked me to come over. I was quite mad at the time because I wanted to ask in my own time when I was prepared. 

I came over and didn’t really say anything, I made it seem like I looked up the wrong person because I felt so awkward.

I want to do equities so slightly different but obviously this is closest I’ll get, I just don’t know wtf to do.

The son is always really busy but I live around the corner so I could defo meet him. Just don’t know how to get through via his mum and also WTF TO SAY OR DO :(

I would really really appreciate some help!

I’ve never networked in my life, it sounds stupid. I’ve been to networking events and just added people on LinkedIn. I always felt networking was weird I saw it as just using people but I’ve slowly learnt, in banking networking is almost key to getting where you want to ( in some cases ).

30,Question on the compounding effect of higher interest rates for less qualified borrowers,"When debtors offer loans they charge higher interest rates if the debt holder is less likely to pay off the loan, thus compensating the debtor for the increased risk (obvious I know, stay with me). My question relates to the implications of the positive relationship between cost to borrow money (interest rates) and inability to payoff said interest rates (low FICO), which clearly has a compounding affect on the risk of default. Does the debtor factor in the fact that they are less likely to get the money back if they charge higher interest rates and does this then tighten the spread of interest rates across quality of borrower?

Each meeting has a theme.  Here's some examples of themes we've had: Blockchain/cryptocurrencies, Millennials investing/saving and their impact on the economy, impact of Amazon on the economy, etc.

My team is starting to run out of ideas for themes.  Can you guys think of any good discussion topics that would be interesting to talk about in a large group setting?

We always find 4-5 news articles on our theme and have all the associates read through them before our roundtable meeting.

Im 19, recently just got a job worlds better than where ive been working since i graduated. Ill be working full time for 13/hr starting monday. My question might seem pretty straightforward to some, but i havent really learned a lot about savings and financial plans due tomy family always living paycheck to paycheck with little to no savings available.
Im working towards buying my first car, as of right now im going to be paying 500 a month to live in my parents house and ill have 1268 left over every month as play money/savings money. My question is- how much each month would be reasonable to put into savings? I thought about adopting the save your hundreds and spend whats left over rule, so in my case i make 884 every 2 weeks, save the 800 and make the 84 last me until my next paycheck. 
I want/need to have a car as soon as i can, but with not too much financial guidance i am not too sure what budget i should even be aiming for for this car. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1534463736,brountide,97xhbh,2,1,True,2018-08-16

179,Looking for some opinions on how best to diversify my available savings into an investment portfolio.,"I have $75k available to invest and these are the options I’m considering:

- Rental properties:
 Apartments, Single family homes, or Two suite properties. I am very experienced with residential construction, design, and building code so this seems like a good fit.  But Im unsure how best to do it.  My ROI will be higher if I leverage it more, so Im thinking I will put down $37.5k on two apartments worth $187.5k each.   Rent those out.  Financing wont be an issue.  A $187k property where I live will likely generate $1300/mo.  
Costs:
$350/mo interest
$350/mo condo fees
$60/mo insurance
$70/mo prop tax
$50/mo maintenance savings fund

Returns:
$370 towards the principal and $50 profit/mo
+2% increase in property value per year.
Roughly a 3%/mo return on $25k. 

Alternate ideas:
No knowledge in these areas, but would they give me a better return?
- TFSA
- RRSP
- Mutual Fund
- Crypto
- Speculative stock
- Gold
- Bonds


I have more than the $75k available, that is an amount Id be comfortable losing, in case people were wondering.

182,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink: Is The Risk Worth The Reward?","Anyone putting any amount of money into cryptocurrency needs to consider risk vs reward. Is the risk of losing a large percentage of your investment worth the potential reward of massive returns? I will attempt to outline why I believe that buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink is a risk worth taking.



**Bitcoin**



Whether you like it or not, Bitcoin is here to stay and it is likely to remain the main store of value and transactional currency in the crypto economy. It has enabled a global currency that is not issued or controlled by any centralized authority, allowing you to send value to anyone in any location without any risk of any entity stopping or intercepting the transaction. It is the most secure network in the world due to the robustness of its proof of work consensus mechanism. An attack on the bitcoin network itself is astronomically cost prohibitive and is unlikely to even be attempted in any serious manor.


Layer 2 solutions are being tested on the Bitcoin main net and will soon bring scalability to the network and enable micro transactions. This will make Bitcoin more functional as a currency.


Scarcity is one of the reasons Bitcoin’s price per coin is so high. There will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. If Bitcoin is adopted in any significant capacity as a payment method and/or as a store of value it would not be unreasonable to see it valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.


BTC price at the time of writing - $6400 Current 

Market Cap - $110 Billion



**Ethereum**



Ethereum uses the same blockchain technology as bitcoin but takes it one step further. Ethereum is Turing complete which allows for decentralized applications to run on the network using smart contracts. Smart contracts are simple “if, then” computations that occur autonomously on the network in a decentralized, trust-less manor. This has many real world implications, but I’ll use sports betting as a simple example. Let’s say I want to bet my friend that the Warriors will win the NBA finals again next season. We can put our money into a smart contract that is programmed to pay out the winner of the bet as soon as the event has occurred. If the warriors win, the money will be sent to me by the contract. I do not have to trust that my friend will pay me. We do not have to trust a centralized party to hold our money and execute the pay out. We only have to trust math and math doesn’t tend to lie.


Ethereum also allows developers to create their own tokens on top of the network which has created an entire separate economy of ICOs (initial coin offerings) and digital collectibles (crypto kitties are actually very cool).


Ethereum already has alliances with many major companies and is positioned to be the main smart contracts platform in the cryptocurrency economy. Ether (ETH) is used as gas to power the Ethereum network and will continue to increase in value in tandem with the usage of the network.


Also, Ethereum will soon be switching from proof of work to proof of stake. As soon as that switch occurs ETH holders will be able to stake their ETH in nodes and earn more in return for running the network. Not only does this provide passive income for holders, but it will also lead to a rise in the price of ETH due The the fact that many coins will be locked in nodes thus suppressing the supply.


ETH price at the time of writing - $290 

Market Cap - $27 Billion



**Chainlink**



Let’s go back to my sports betting example. The smart contract that my friend and I are using for our bet needs to know who won the NBA finals in order to know whether to pay me or my friend. If that data is not being fed into our smart contract in a decentralized, trust-less manor then our contract itself is no longer decentralized and trust-less. That is where Chainlink comes in. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that will allow trust-less data integration onto any blockchain. One of the most valuable aspects of Chainlink is that it is blockchain agnostic and can be used for any public, private, or permissioned blockchain. Currently one of their main focuses is to provide blockchain solutions for interbank telecommunications. They are working with Swift which is the main organization in this field.


Chainlink is not yet functional making it the riskiest endeavor of the 3, but it also has the highest potential for reward. There are currently no competitors in the decentralized oracle space. The reason being that the oracle problem is an incredibly difficult problem to solve and the creator of Chainlink has been working on it for over 4 years which is an eternity in the blockchain world. The main net is nearly complete and should be released within the next few months although there is no specific release date.


Once Chainlink is online, people will be able to run nodes to help feed data into smart contracts. The node operators will be paid for this service. Running a node is not as simple a staking, but there are companies such as Linkpool that will allow anyone to contribute their Link tokens to a node and enjoy some of the profits. This will have a similar effect as ETH in limiting the supply and likely increasing the price.


LINK price at the time of writing - $.26 

Market Cap - $95 Million



Many people are currently saying that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will never again reach their all time highs of last year, but let’s take a look at the numbers. The total crypto market cap at the all time high was approximately $800 Billion. This is not a large number to begin with, but it’s also inflated due to the way market cap is calculated in cryptocurrencies. Market cap is determined by coin supply multiplied by the last price per coin. This means that I could create my own coin right now with a supply of 1 million coins, sell 1 coin to 1 person for $1 and my coin would be said to have a market cap of $1 million. This is clearly not actually the case. That being said, even $800 billion is not much when you consider the fact that Apple just hit $1 Trillion by itself and that the dot com bubble didn’t burst until it reached a $2 trillion market cap.


Large financial institutions don’t have easy access to cryptocurrencies yet, but they are interested and they will have access very soon. Most likely in the form of a Bitcoin ETF. The last crypto bull run was fueled by retail investors. The next one will be fueled by institutional investors and it will be magnitudes greater in size.


Putting money into crypto right now is still risky, but the potential reward is massive. Not only for huge returns on your initial investment, but also for streams of passive income from currencies such as ETH and LINK. We may be seeing the beginning of the world’s next great technological innovation and this time you can invest in it directly. Opportunities like this don’t arise often, so I highly recommend giving this one some thought.",finance,1534469635,TG_King,97y6fm,6,1,True,2018-08-16

If I write it a letter about what I'd like to see in the future, would they even read it? that's the first part of the quesiton is if they'd even ever see it.

Second, if a couple of my ideas included statistics about how it may profit them in doing so (I won't be specific here for time and privacy), would that come off as pretentious? Would that be saying to them that I think I'm better or that they are stupid?

Third, and perhaps most important. If I include things that their competitor Hasbro (owns Magic the Gathering, a competitor of FF TCG) has done to the detriment of their own product, as something that Square Enix said in their sales report they were attempting to do, and is something that I would caution against, would that be a weird thing to do? Mentioning a competitor of theirs in a letter, is that too much? I would be using statistics provided in Hasbros 2017 sales report in their own words.

22,Business/Entrepreneurship vs College (STEM),"Lately, I've read up on tons of books and videos of both college and business. From what I learned, people with computer science degree earns on average of 80K yearly straight out of a 4 year college. Assuming they did the projects and have prior work experience with stuff related to computers before graduating. But on average entrepreneur and businessmen can make anywhere between 60k-90k yearly. And of which 90% business fail during starting up. 

I had a talk with my friend the other day who is the same age as me 18, but with a lower income household. He said he will go ahead and try to start up a apparel business and learn in the next few years from his own mistake. While working a $10-$16 hourly job to support his investments.

But on the other hand instead of doing that. I want to spend my next 4 years learning about computers and doing projects/internship, earning a Bachelor in C.S. So when I get out of college, I'll have a job in no time and already be making 80K yearly. With that 80k yearly, I am going to reinvest it in things such as business and estate.

Both routes seems risky, if the business doesn't succeed. You will be in more debt than when you started. And with the C.S. Degree, there is also a chance I wont get the job first year out of school. The university will cost me about $1000 yearly and $10k total if i decide to go to main PSU campus. 

I would like to hear some opinion on this. And it seems to fit in this section the best. If I should invest in a business or go to college and earn about the same of a average succeeding business.",finance,1534124467,NewbieCasanova,96u9qg,6,1,True,2018-08-12

156,NEED HELP PLEASE think I'm being scammed,"So my girlfriend and I moved into a really shady ""apartment"" (which was actually an extention they had built onto a building a while back) and my ex-landlord was nothing but money hungry and what seems like to me a scammer taking advantage of young kids. My brother who I have no contact with and is a drug addict broke into my apartment and destroyed property, furniture, etc. (he had stayed there less than 10 times so not a frequent or welcomed guest, he's homeless) So then my landlord said my girlfriend and I were responsible for all the damages that happened in the burglary. She pressed us weekly for payments to her when we were trying to get things settled with the court and we pushed it off every time because we didn't feel we should've been liable for a burglary just because I happen to be related to the burglar. She blamed us not having renters insurance? Anyways, we took in two strays (cats) and didn't pay the pet fee which is our fault admittedly but as soon as she found out she took it as the oppertunity to evict us completely on July 1st even though we had no prior problems at all besides the cats. She somehow racked up a bill of $3,000 that we owe even though we definetly did nothing even close to 3,000 worth of damage during our stay there and its a shit apartment with cracks in the walls, appliences falling apart etc. I think they sold us the shittiest property they had and made us sign up for it being young and inexperienced and now are raking in as much money from us that they can. They are also still charging us rent and electricity until they rent to somebody new and some ""rerental fee"" and giving us late fees for months were not even living there. Here's a picture of the top half of our bill statement. (the lease broken incentive fee is because we had the first four months half off rent so they could get rid of that piece of shit property)

I am sure that most of my peers will write some narrative  but I believe there is a way that this could be quantified but having trouble wrapping my head around it.

The scenario for most subcontracts is that the supplier invoices monthly for the work completed that month.  My first thought was I could take the sum of the NPVs of the remainder of the subcontract payments under 30 day terms minus the sum of NPV of the payments under 45 day terms  and then compare that numebr to the estimated cost of me renegotiating the contract.

I am not sure that gets me there though.  does r/finance have any thoughts on how I could set this up?",finance,1534219570,itsjustkeyrock,9758i7,0,1,True,2018-08-14

310,What are Ramifications of paying collection agency?,"Background: We are a middle class family and has health insurance.  About 7 months ago we went to a doctor for some check up.  Since our insurance is high deductable, and we didn’t meet the deductible yet we were responsible for the whole bill.  We later recieved a bill,  being lazy, I kept it for a while and forgot.  3 months after I remembered it because they sent us another bill and I paid it.  However,  I didnt realized this bill was a bill for a separate procedure.  So basically I paid for omly 1 bill.  Fast forward, since I didnt pay the first bill it went to collection.  When I saw that, I freaked out and paid the collection the full amount. 
Question:  having paid the collection im full, will that affect my credit score?  Since I read that paying collection agency is basically admitting guilt (which in my case being a dumbass and lazy). But I really worry about the consequence in real life since we are planing to buy a house next year.  Thanks guys.

365,Question on the compounding effect of higher interest rates for less qualified borrowers,"When debtors offer loans they charge higher interest rates if the debt holder is less likely to pay off the loan, thus compensating the debtor for the increased risk (obvious I know, stay with me). My question relates to the implications of the positive relationship between cost to borrow money (interest rates) and inability to payoff said interest rates (low FICO), which clearly has a compounding affect on the risk of default. Does the debtor factor in the fact that they are less likely to get the money back if they charge higher interest rates and does this then tighten the spread of interest rates across quality of borrower? Interested to hear speculation on this question. ",finance,1534383880,dumgenius,97o4vi,1,1,True,2018-08-15

We are not moving with jobs lined up, and I’ve already quit my job to work on getting our house ready to sell.

What is the best way for us to buy a house while selling ours so that close dates are compatible? Should we take a mortgage out on our house or should we buy the new house with a mortgage and pay it off completely with the sale of ours? Is there a third option I’m unfamiliar with?

Most of the other staff come from business backgrounds, so I feel like I'm at a disadvantage. I'm not sure where to look other than browsing YouTube to get familiar with these concepts, so I was hoping that someone could point me in the right direction.

The relevant concepts are:

* Escheatment
* Dividends, interest, and their calculation/day rules
* DTC
* Cede and Co.
* Wire, check, and ACH payments
* DRIP
* DWAC
* Bond calls
* Bond paydowns and payups

Right now I have a crossover in fantastic condition without any problems, the total loan was for 13,000 (approx) 2 years ago, as of **today I owe 9,300.** I have already put 15000 miles on it since I purchased it.

I was looking at a vehicle which would be much better suited for my family and needs (life changes quick!) . I have done some extensive research and **the car I would like to purchase is valued at 12,000.** 

Another reason I am looking into trading my current car in is because although I purchased the car for 13000 it is now worth just 9,000 (private party) and **the dealer offered 6,000 for a trade in value**. 

How exactly would this situation work? **Would I need to pay money down?** Would I be able to get a better rate since I have kept up with all my payments? **What should I know before going to the dealer?**

I am super worried if I wait any longer my car will continue to depreciate and be worthless when I am done paying off the loan. But as you may have figured out already this is my first financed vehicle and I am not knowledgeable beyond what I have already done.

Any suggestions or tips would be very helpful! If I am leaving out any important info let me know and I will be sure to fill in any missing details.

From what I learned, people with computer science degree earns on average of 80K yearly straight out of a 4 year college. Assuming they did the projects and have prior work experience with stuff related to computers before graduating. But on average entrepreneur and businessmen can make anywhere between 60k-90k yearly. And of which 90% business fail during starting up. 

I had a talk with my friend the other day who is the same age as me 18, but with a lower income household. He said he will go ahead and try to start up a apparel business and learn in the next few years from his own mistake. While working a $10-$16 hourly job to support his investments.

But on the other hand instead of doing that. I want to spend my next 4 years learning about computers and doing projects/internship, earning a Bachelor in C.S. So when I get out of college, I'll have a job in no time and already be making 80K yearly. With that 80k yearly, I am going to reinvest it in things such as business and estate.

Both routes seems risky, if the business doesn't succeed. You will be in more debt than when you started. And with the C.S. Degree, there is also a chance I wont get the job first year out of school. The university will cost me about $1000 yearly and $10k total if i decide to go to main PSU campus. 

I would like to hear some opinion on this. And it seems to fit in this section the best. If I should invest in a business or go to college and earn about the same of a average succeeding business.",finance,1534124467,NewbieCasanova,96u9qg,6,1,True,2018-08-12

395,NEED HELP PLEASE think I'm being scammed,"So my girlfriend and I moved into a really shady ""apartment"" (which was actually an extention they had built onto a building a while back) and my ex-landlord was nothing but money hungry and what seems like to me a scammer taking advantage of young kids. My brother who I have no contact with and is a drug addict broke into my apartment and destroyed property, furniture, etc. (he had stayed there less than 10 times so not a frequent or welcomed guest, he's homeless) So then my landlord said my girlfriend and I were responsible for all the damages that happened in the burglary. She pressed us weekly for payments to her when we were trying to get things settled with the court and we pushed it off every time because we didn't feel we should've been liable for a burglary just because I happen to be related to the burglar. She blamed us not having renters insurance? Anyways, we took in two strays (cats) and didn't pay the pet fee which is our fault admittedly but as soon as she found out she took it as the oppertunity to evict us completely on July 1st even though we had no prior problems at all besides the cats. She somehow racked up a bill of $3,000 that we owe even though we definetly did nothing even close to 3,000 worth of damage during our stay there and its a shit apartment with cracks in the walls, appliences falling apart etc. I think they sold us the shittiest property they had and made us sign up for it being young and inexperienced and now are raking in as much money from us that they can. They are also still charging us rent and electricity until they rent to somebody new and some ""rerental fee"" and giving us late fees for months were not even living there. Here's a picture of the top half of our bill statement. (the lease broken incentive fee is because we had the first four months half off rent so they could get rid of that piece of shit property)

I am sure that most of my peers will write some narrative  but I believe there is a way that this could be quantified but having trouble wrapping my head around it.

The scenario for most subcontracts is that the supplier invoices monthly for the work completed that month.  My first thought was I could take the sum of the NPVs of the remainder of the subcontract payments under 30 day terms minus the sum of NPV of the payments under 45 day terms  and then compare that numebr to the estimated cost of me renegotiating the contract.

I am not sure that gets me there though.  does r/finance have any thoughts on how I could set this up?",finance,1534219570,itsjustkeyrock,9758i7,0,1,True,2018-08-14

177,Internal struggle with saving vs spending,"Everyone in my life labels me as a “cheap” person. For me it’s because I paid for college myself and why go out to dinner or movies as a college kid when I worked 30+hrs while a full time student to barely afford tuition. I can enjoy chilling with friends at the beach or something free. Then I came out of college during recession and it was very difficult to find a job. It took about 7 months and at the time paying rent off savings, I’d have felt crazy to have ever spent money on something material or anything to celebrate graduating when I could barely afford rent.
Flash forward to now. I am in a great job and make good money for my age. I worked up the ladder and have a very good manager position for my late twenties. I still can’t kick my cheapness.
I have always appreciated luxuries, nice cars and handbags. I love them. I’ve always told myself once I reach my goal I’ll get myself “x” to reward myself. Every time I hit the goal I chicken out of buying it. I keep going back to a fear of not having enough money when I’ll need it. 
I own a property that I rent and then own a property with my fiancé that we split. Yet, for some reason I’m always afraid of money.
I’d love to buy or lease a Lexus or Mercedes, even get myself a Louis Vuitton or channel bag even taking a vacation for first time in my life. I just keep fearing losing my job or needing money for a down payment of a new house or anything like that. That if I end up losing job that I’d feel ridiculous having some beautiful bag but no job. 

My friends tried to help me kick this habit then invite me on trips. I turned them down but oddly one friend came back and then lost her job and couldn’t afford rent and had to sleep on friends couches for 3 months. I kept thinking, damn if she didn’t just spend 2k on that trip she’d have some savings to fall back on. These are the very things that scare me. 

It’s just gotten so bad lately that I can’t seem to even spend money on anything like going out with friends even though money isn’t an issue anymore. It’s always this future thought I have. Like what if I want to retire early. The biggest thing retirees wish they did when younger is save more for retirement. 
I can almost feel like a pain in my heart when I swipe my credit card.

Has this ever happened to someone? Where cheapness is this big of a problem? Where it actually stops you from doing what you want. 
Any idea how to kick this feeling. I would like to enjoy life a bit but I can’t seem to balance. 

I’d love to have nice things but this is really driving me crazy lately.

344,UK inheritance tax advice for my 93 year old grandma.,"Hi all, 

I wondered if I could ask some advice regarding UK IHT. 

My grandma currently owns a house valued at around £345,000 and has some other assets that my family would inherit on her death. She is currently 93, so we do not expect her to last another 7 years if she gifted it to us. 

The house and assets are currently left in her will to my mum and my uncle (my grandma’s son), and it would be both of their second property. 

When my grandad passed away, everything owned went straight to my grandma, so he did not use any of his IHT allowance. 

I just want to check that my understanding of this situation is correct; 

- Will my mum and uncle have to pay any extra money due to it being their second property? 

- Is it true that my grandma has £450k of her own tax free allowance if she passes it to her children, plus the £450k of my grandad’s allowance rolled over, to give her a total of £900k tax free? 

I’m quite worried about this as we couldn’t afford to pay any IHT on the property, and it is a lovely house it would be a shame to lose. 

Thank you so much in advance. ",finance,1533738129,NicNole,95mf9f,0,1,True,2018-08-08

356,Help a DACA student go to college.,"Hello reddit, my name is Carlos. I don't know which subreddits to post this on but I will submit it to as many as I can. I've been a Redditor for awhile. I am here for help and advise as well. 

I am 18 years old and I am a US immigrant who is under DACA ( Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ). I have lived in the United States for almost 18 years of my life and consider myself an American. My parents were born in Morelos, Mexico as well as myself. When I was one year old they decided to come to the United States for a better future for them and I. They came to Tennessee and we have lived here ever since. They both got jobs and have been providing to their family ever since, scrapping by but definitely a lot more than back at their hometown.  They had two more children in the United States. My two sisters who I love very much, I'm so happy for them because they are US citizens and will be able to take advantage of many opportunities, thanks to my parents.  I recently graduated High School and now I would love to go to college to pave a path for a better future. Unfortunately I am not eligible for Federal Student loans and I can't even qualify for Tennessee Promise. I have looked into other scholarships such as [this one](http://www.thedream.us) , but it isn't partnered with the college I am going too. 

I have always been a good kid in school and i have never failed a grade. I was always well behaved and kept my grades up. Now that college is coming up, I recently found out that I am not eligible for any type of financial aid. I am registered in the selective service and I have completed my fafsa. I go to work because I qualify for a Work permit and I am legally allowed to work in the United States. I also pay taxes and I contribute as any other American would but I am still not legally considered as a legal resident. I have applied for many scholarships, one specifically I was looking forward to was the Tennessee Promise scholarship. Two free years of college, it was an amazing opportunity and I did every requirement. I did community service and I went to every meeting but in the end I found out I'm not even [eligible](https://imgur.com/qAUi6hp). I still want to go to college. I am studying [Computer]( https://imgur.com/gYiSHWf) Tech at Volunteer State University. 

Unfortunately, on top of not being able to qualify for many scholarships , they told me I have to pay Out-of-State tuition because I do not legally reside here. I think it is outrageous that I am not able to get the same opportunities as my peers. Friends that I have had since elementary school. Having lived in the United States for almost 18 years of my life. This is where I need your help. Out of state [tuition](https://imgur.com/yx9eRLo) is $8669, nearly four times as much as in state [tuition](https://imgur.com/Uqsu3L6). The in-state-tuition being $2216.

With the current job I have making $10 an hour and with what is in my savings I barely can cover my textbooks. My parents cannot afford this either. My parents came to the united states so I can become something better because they never completed high school themselves. Ill be damned if I don't become something in life. my parents sacrificed their lives for me and I am grateful. All I'm asking for is my first semester tuition. Thank you for reading this.

361,Credit Card Consolidation - Have to close older card and reduce credit limit to $1000??,"Hey all.

I have a decent job these days, but a few years ago was out of work for health reasons for a while.

I applied for and was approved for a debt consolidation loan from my credit union to improve my credit score and reduce my APRs. 

I tacked on 1300 for a veterinary bill and 1000 to buy a car from a friend.

Everything sounds good (9.9%APR for 60 months with a FICO of 680/672) compared to $2300 @ 16.9%APR and $700 @ 28.9%. 

The only thing that seems like a disadvantage is that they want me to close my American Express card. It has the 28.9% interest and late payments from several years ago, but it's my oldest card. It has a limit of only $1000.

My Citibank card has 16.9% interest and a limit of 2700 (they randomly bumped it up from 1600). 

I can understand why they don't want someone to pay off their credit cards with a loan and then run them up again. However, cutting my available credit down to $1000 from $2700 sounds kind of terrible. I've been told that new (since the 2008 crash) regulations prevent consumers from asking for credit limit increases. 

The main thing is that I've only had the Citi card for about 2 years.

Is this a common stipulation? ",finance,1533748666,Polymathy1,95nzsa,8,1,True,2018-08-08

378,"What, technically, makes a bank a bank?","Just to preface this statement, I'm well versed in finance. This is just a strange thought I had today that simple googling hasn't given me the answers to.

What is the definition of a ""bank""? Traditionally, it's a financial intermediary that accepts deposits and makes loans. Sure, we all know that. It fits the bill for commercial banking, central banking, etc. But what makes an investment bank a bank? It doesn't accept deposits. Is the definition of a ""bank"" simply a ""financial intermediary that creates credit""? If this is the case, there are hordes of other companies involved in lending which could (but aren't) considered a ""bank"". 

It seems to me that investment banks aren't really banks at all. They're just providers of financial services (M&amp;A, S&amp;T, underwriting financial products, etc etc.) who happen to historically been divisions of pre-existing commercial banks. 

What I'm getting at is, are investment banks really banks? Just because the business is affiliated with commercial banking and more or less is a derivative of that whole world, doesn't make it a bank... The term ""financial services company"" seems significantly more fitting. Can someone shed some light on this?",finance,1533761136,aProfessionalManatee,95pvtp,10,1,True,2018-08-08

406,Degree/Major question,"I don’t know if this is the correct place to ask this, but I had a question regarding what I should be studying if I’m looking to pursue a career in finance/tech (ideally some mixture of both), or possibly something like quantitative finance if I decide to get a masters related to that.

My background is: I’m a rising junior Computer Science major with a Math minor at an average state school in the US (ranked in the top 30s overall, a bit higher for business I think), but I didn’t want to graduate limited to only one field (in this case tech), so I was looking at other combinations of majors/minors.

I went through a few options that I found interesting - math (wouldn’t really be a different field if paired with cs, so I didn’t major in it, but still useful so I minored), bio (didn’t really see any application with just a bachelors in this) and economics and finance.

Now, the way the finance and Econ departments are structured here are: finance is in the school of business, while Econ is in the school of arts/sciences (idk why). I’m currently in the school of arts and sciences in the CS dept. If I were to go for the finance major (they don’t offer a minor) then I would have to go through a transfer process into the school of business, as well as take a bunch of business core classes, most of which don’t directly relate to finance. This would pretty much mean that I’d end up taking twice as many classes and might have to take some over summers along with internships (hopefully), which would be very stressful. Econ is very doable since I am almost done with my CS and math, and if I don’t finish I can swap to just a minor.

My only concern is: would Econ actually teach me as much relevant information as finance for what I’m trying to do? I’ve had friends that are finance majors tell me that Econ gets you a pretty similar career path, just that finance gets you more business-related classes through the core classes from the business school.

TL;DR:

I’m looking to go for a career in finance&amp;tech, currently cs major math minor, trying to decide between a finance major (nearly 2x classes, might be difficult to finish on time) vs Econ major (very doable, but not as business-focused as finance from what I’ve heard). Would Econ prepare me with the same foundation as finance for what I want to pursue?

Sorry for the long post, thanks in advance!

I don't understand a thing, maybe  because I am not native  ebglish, would  you please explain to me  what does this mean?  
 

I have  2  questions:  
 

Question 1)  
 

*''****Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)***  
 

*Volume weighted average price strategy breaks up a large order and  releases dynamically determined smaller chunks of the order to the  market using stock-specific historical volume profiles. The aim is to  execute the order close to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).''*  
 

**What  does it mean ''breaks uo a large order using stock specific hystorical volume  profiles''?**  
 

**What  is  this indicator ? (Historical volume profiles)? I  have never heard  about  it. What  does it  shows  to us?** **Does it  compute an average  of  all the  volume  traded  in  N  days?**  
 

**And  why does  it execute the  order  CLOSE TO  the  VWAP?  Wouldn't  it be better  to execute it  ABOVE, OR BELOW  the  VWAP?**  
   
 

Question number 2  
   
 *Time weighted average price strategy breaks up a large order and  releases dynamically determined smaller chunks of the order to the  market using evenly divided time slots between a start and end time. The  aim is to execute the order close to the average price between the  start and end times, thereby minimizing market impact.*  
 

***What  does it means  with ''releases dynamically determined  smaller chunks of the order to the market using evenly divided time  slots between a start and end time'' ?***  
 

***Basically:  I have  a  large sell order,  I want to  execute it    above  or  close to the VWAP, then  I split  the  order  time to time  until  is it  filled at  my condition? Does this  mean with that prhase?***

I was planning on applying for a Bank of America Summer Advisor internship for next summer. The preferred GPA is a 3.2. My gpa is below a 3.0 because of a rough freshman year of college in a computer science class. However, I am very good friends with a Senior Vice President - Wealth Management/Senior Financial Advisor of the company who personally told me to reach out to him for a potential internship offer. i also am in the works of possibly interning for a fortune 500 company in Miami for next summer, and I don't know exactly their GPA requirements but I am basically the nephew of the CEO. Should I go with the internship in Miami and get my GPA higher and apply my senior year or can my resume get pushed through because I have a connection?",finance,1533445183,wakanda101,94phsl,2,1,True,2018-08-05
93,Finance Major - Would love some advice on Summer Internships,"I'll go ahead and give my background. So I'm going into my second year of university as a Finance major and have always been drawn to investing in stocks (but I suck due to not knowing how to do all the fancy modeling yet) and find that area really cool but when it comes to previous job experience I have none,  and in terms of real ""finance"" classes I have yet to take any (first years of uni are liberal arts classes + pre-reqs. Which leads me to my current problem, I don't know what summer internship to seek let alone how to land it. I have financial accounting/business stats/macro/micro/ so far and once I do managerial acc 2 I can start to do corporate finance course in spring + risk management one/business analytics.  

For example I've done the research on many positions and ""investment/asset/wealth management"" intern seems closest to investing in stocks/managing portfolios but without actually doing that I can't for certain say that's what I want. Also in other areas like  ""corporate finance"" &amp;  2 ""investment banking"" I don't know either.  


1) I've never worked for a corporation so I don't know what it would be like doing day-to-day decisions on operations and management? Fun? Perhaps, I just wouldn't know...

2)  I've never done any Merger or Acquisition of a company so I don't know if it would be fun doing these? I just don't know either how to model leverage buyout overview so I don't know where I would learn this or if any of my future finance classes will teach it.

Sorry if this all feels like a rant but I feel I'm at the point I need to secure a summer internship for summer 2019 but don't know how to land a job for something I have never done? I have a 3.85 GPA and plan to take intermediate accounting in the spring but what course do I need to take to learn on M&amp;As/MLO's? and how/when to do the models of CAPM/DDM /NAV formula? All of these I've heard of but never fully learned/understood them enough to apply them to real investing. 

So if there is a few things I could ask of you guys.  


1) What is the best finance internship to put on a resume? (investment banking summer analyst)?? 

2) What steps do I need to take now to secure any summer analyst position? 

3) At Goldman I see a massive list of ""finance related"" things so how can I know which one is the best to try out or the hardest or what exactly I need to self-teach myself during this upcoming year to be ready for them?

I'll list the positions to give an example  
Finance - "" Controllers &amp; Tax or Corporate Treasury &amp; Bank Finance. "" 

Consumer &amp; Commercial Banking

Global Compliance 

Global Investment Research

### Investment Banking

### Investment Management

### Merchant Banking

### Operations

### Securities

### Risk

Now I know each of these positions are ""slightly different"" so how can I know which to best go for or what exactly to teach myself. I run into the problem when I read the job descriptions because they all use similar buzz words about ""working with clients"" ""risk"" ""investing"" etc and without actually doing the job or taking a previous class it doesn't tell me much about what I should focus on trying to get.

4) If there is one thing I would really appreciate advice on is a step-by-step advice on every book I need to read, every formula/concept they expect me to know prior to applying, and assuming it's too late to land a internship (I will still try for summer 2020) with these elite banks  but I can try and land a random company finance one but what is the best ""equivalent"" type? Corporate finance at a random place?

I really appreciate any and all advice I get.

TL-DR: No finance job experience, no finance class experience, what are best summer finance internships to have on resume and how can I land them. (not concerned with what I like/dislike since I haven't done any previously so there is none I would dislike trying) I just want to know what to focus on/self learn this year to try and land a good one. What are the must know things + where can I learn them? Also, what ""division"" is the best to try and get (see question 3) because with so many I often have a hard time trying to figure out because they all seem interesting and related to finance.",finance,1533446397,Boneyg001,94ploc,2,1,True,2018-08-05

I’m not great at solving equations but I’m quick with basic math like adding, subtracting, multiplication, and division. The reason I choose finance was because I’ve always been the best person with money for my age out of pretty much everyone I know. Money management is my strong suit I would say. My math skills aren’t the best for solving equations like pre calc or even the harder algebra though I pass but with low 80s. To be fair I didn’t give it my 100% but I find myself confused during class often but somehow do good enough to pass the test. Does someone in the finance field need to be good at complicated math equations to land a $70k+ job? What field of finance would you recommend? If not finance what field would you recommend? Thanks in advance 

TLDR: wondering if finance is for me. Very good at managing money ever since I was little, not so good at solving complex equations. I’m quick with 4 basic maths. Is it necessary for me to be good at complex math to land a high paying job? What concentration of finance do you recommend? If finance doesn’t sound like it’s for me what field would you recommend?

What do you think of this edition of “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham? Warren Buffett claims it is, “The best book ever written on investing”. 

Warren Buffett was a student of Graham’s, and that this book has amazing insight that can still be used today when investing in the stock market, our health, knowledge, and even friends. In this short animated review of “The Intelligent Investor” I cover the main topics presented in the book such as investing vs. speculating, the role of inflation, rules about fundamental investing, and margin of safety.",finance,1533641001,dmwes4,95ari6,0,1,True,2018-08-07

420,Internal struggle with saving vs spending,"Everyone in my life labels me as a “cheap” person. For me it’s because I paid for college myself and why go out to dinner or movies as a college kid when I worked 30+hrs while a full time student to barely afford tuition. I can enjoy chilling with friends at the beach or something free. Then I came out of college during recession and it was very difficult to find a job. It took about 7 months and at the time paying rent off savings, I’d have felt crazy to have ever spent money on something material or anything to celebrate graduating when I could barely afford rent.
Flash forward to now. I am in a great job and make good money for my age. I worked up the ladder and have a very good manager position for my late twenties. I still can’t kick my cheapness.
I have always appreciated luxuries, nice cars and handbags. I love them. I’ve always told myself once I reach my goal I’ll get myself “x” to reward myself. Every time I hit the goal I chicken out of buying it. I keep going back to a fear of not having enough money when I’ll need it. 
I own a property that I rent and then own a property with my fiancé that we split. Yet, for some reason I’m always afraid of money.
I’d love to buy or lease a Lexus or Mercedes, even get myself a Louis Vuitton or channel bag even taking a vacation for first time in my life. I just keep fearing losing my job or needing money for a down payment of a new house or anything like that. That if I end up losing job that I’d feel ridiculous having some beautiful bag but no job. 

My friends tried to help me kick this habit then invite me on trips. I turned them down but oddly one friend came back and then lost her job and couldn’t afford rent and had to sleep on friends couches for 3 months. I kept thinking, damn if she didn’t just spend 2k on that trip she’d have some savings to fall back on. These are the very things that scare me. 

It’s just gotten so bad lately that I can’t seem to even spend money on anything like going out with friends even though money isn’t an issue anymore. It’s always this future thought I have. Like what if I want to retire early. The biggest thing retirees wish they did when younger is save more for retirement. 
I can almost feel like a pain in my heart when I swipe my credit card.

Has this ever happened to someone? Where cheapness is this big of a problem? Where it actually stops you from doing what you want. 
Any idea how to kick this feeling. I would like to enjoy life a bit but I can’t seem to balance. 

I’d love to have nice things but this is really driving me crazy lately.

13,American Airlines’ New No Annual Fee Rewards Credit Card,"American Airlines and Citi have just launched a credit card that will be particularly attractive to those new to the miles- and points-earning game. Why? The new AA credit card allows you to earn miles easily, while eliminating that pesky annual fee that sometimes turns off a lot of potential new cardholders. While those who’ve been collecting miles and points for a while can usually find the value in the extra perks an annual fee provides, for those just starting out or the infrequent traveler who still wants to earn miles, it can be an annoyance.

So what does American Airlines’ new card offer?

Available as of last week, the new card gives you:

 - 2 AAdvantage miles for every $1 spent on American Airlines purchases
 - 2 AAdvantage miles for every $1 spent at the grocery store
 - 1 AAdvantage mile for every $1 spent on all other purchases

I been lurking in this subreddit for a while and I enjoy and try to learn from all the great advice you guys give.  I think I finally saved enough money to be my turn to ask. I will keep it quick:

31M/In a Relationship 

No student loans or credit card debt (Paid off 110K in 2 years)

Graduated 3 years ago - medical field 135k/year 

60k in low interest saving account 

10k in some high risk stock (20% return within 8 month-waiting for 1 year to get out)

60k in 401K (Max every year + employee match)

Spending

Living With Parents ($800 support/month)

Car Lease ($330)

Phone ($150)

Future: 

30-40k down to buy a house 150-200k in the next 2 years

30k-40k for marriage in the next 2 years

Currently saving 4k a month 

I was thinking of investion at least 40k into twitter/facebook after the recent crash (especially Facebook since I have a lot of faith in it) maybe 10k and 20k and putting the rest into a ETF fund such as SPY and keeping only 20k in online high yield saving account.  I am just afraid I am in the downturn of the economic cycle and this is not the right time to get in.

100,Hedging with derivatives - some simple questions (assignment..),"Hi all,

I have two scenarios that needs to be appropriately hedged using derivative instruments (some school task i have to complete). 

Case 1:

A mortgage bank would like to offer a 10-year fixed mortgage rate of 2.5% to its customers. Its main business is to take short term deposits from retail investors and offer long-term mortgages. 

The hedging solution has to be based on a interest rate swap. As i see it, the bank should swap, so that it receives fixed interest rate and pays based on the current floating rate. 

Case 2: 

A US based company knows it will receive a future payment in £GBP. The payment will be received in 5 months.

The hedge must be based on futures contract. As i see it, the company should sell USD/GBP futures (equivalent in value to the future GBP payment) in order to lock in the price and hedge for volatility. 

Please correct me if my assumptions and solution are incorrect. This is for a school assignment, and i have little experience in risk management and hedging in general. This is a general assignment, and they are looking for general understanding of the different concepts.

I don't understand a thing, maybe  because I am not native  ebglish, would  you please explain to me  what does this mean?  
 

I have  2  questions:  
 

Question 1)  
 

*''****Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)***  
 

*Volume weighted average price strategy breaks up a large order and  releases dynamically determined smaller chunks of the order to the  market using stock-specific historical volume profiles. The aim is to  execute the order close to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).''*  
 

**What  does it mean ''breaks uo a large order using stock specific hystorical volume  profiles''?**  
 

**What  is  this indicator ? (Historical volume profiles)? I  have never heard  about  it. What  does it  shows  to us?** **Does it  compute an average  of  all the  volume  traded  in  N  days?**  
 

**And  why does  it execute the  order  CLOSE TO  the  VWAP?  Wouldn't  it be better  to execute it  ABOVE, OR BELOW  the  VWAP?**  
   
 

Question number 2  
   
 *Time weighted average price strategy breaks up a large order and  releases dynamically determined smaller chunks of the order to the  market using evenly divided time slots between a start and end time. The  aim is to execute the order close to the average price between the  start and end times, thereby minimizing market impact.*  
 

***What  does it means  with ''releases dynamically determined  smaller chunks of the order to the market using evenly divided time  slots between a start and end time'' ?***  
 

***Basically:  I have  a  large sell order,  I want to  execute it    above  or  close to the VWAP, then  I split  the  order  time to time  until  is it  filled at  my condition? Does this  mean with that prhase?***

I'm a seasoned data scientist who is trying to break into financial analytics and I figured the best way to start would be a project.

I'd like to begin building a clustering algorithm to categorize stocks including features like industry, market cap, beta. Ideally I'll have around 15 data features, both technical and fundamental, to include in my model. 

Unfortunately, I don't quite know what terms to read up on. I figured the people here may be able to give me a few and save me hours of reading and research. I could run a regression on hundreds of fields to find important indicators as well, but that would also take quite a bit of time. Would appreciate any suggestions!

Thanks!",finance,1532827650,Butt_Bopper,92r830,2,1,True,2018-07-28

So, with Direct Listings, I'm still a bit confused as to how the company determines what to price shares at? Wouldn't they still need help from some intermediary to decide what a fair market price would be?

Also, with IPOs, my understanding is that you pay for two things. 1) Help with Publicizing IPO/Pricing 2) Risk that the bank takes on when they quote the company a set price.

So, what if you just wanted help with step 1, but you'd take the bank's price for your stock and then sell a % of your company at that price (to fundraise) without relying on the bank to take the risk?

217,Just found out an old friend has lied to me and created a ponzi scheme with a dozen others. What recourse do I have?,"Hey all,

Recently I discovered that an old friend has been lying to me. Directly. In my face. I know that seems common place to read about now but it's still shocking coming from someone you thought you could trust. Let me say first that I do not do personal loans mostly out of fear that something like this might happen but in this case...well I'm not exactly sure what happened.

I lent this friend approximately $15k USD in November of 2017 on a 3 month loan with interest. The funds were to complete renovations on a house in Southern California ( verified that he \*did\* own it at the time). After speaking with each other via video chat and (I thought) verifying that he was still the same person I knew (hadn't spoken in years) and was not full of shit (he was), we exchanged a docusign and funds were sent through PayPal, Cash app and one other e-service. The docusign states that I may place a lien on the property but it's no longer in his name...

Now I find out that he has lied about doing this exact same con to roughly a dozen others, for far more $$ over the last two years. To date we all believe that he has ponzied around roughly 450k USD. He has sent multiple bounced checks and fake wires to people in order to ""repay"" them (isn't that a felony?) and the recipient somehow were hung with the bounce fees.

\- To date none of us knows where the money has gone. 

\- None of us have been paid ( I think one person got $100)

\- He has been confronted by several of us together and \*fully admitted\* that he lied to all of us and robbed Peter to pay Paul (found this out too late, of course)

\- Is currently telling me that he is going to pay my $ back from the ""new job"" he's got (Linked in \_\_appears\_\_ to verify the job? Hard to tell)

I realize that some will take the usual route and respond with, ""Don't lend money to friends"" but we're unfortunately past that here. 

I would be entirely grateful to any who might have some good advice to follow.

Why? The new AA credit card allows you to earn miles easily, while eliminating that pesky annual fee that sometimes turns off a lot of potential new cardholders. While those who’ve been collecting miles and points for a while can usually find the value in the extra perks an annual fee provides, for those just starting out or the infrequent traveler who still wants to earn miles, it can be an annoyance.

So what does American Airlines’ new card offer?

Available as of last week, the new card gives you:

 - 2 AAdvantage miles for every $1 spent on American Airlines purchases
 - 2 AAdvantage miles for every $1 spent at the grocery store
 - 1 AAdvantage mile for every $1 spent on all other purchases

60k in low interest saving account 

10k in some high risk stock (20% return within 8 month-waiting for 1 year to get out)

60k in 401K (Max every year + employee match)

Spending

Living With Parents ($800 support/month)

Car Lease ($330)

Phone ($150)

Future: 

30-40k down to buy a house 150-200k in the next 2 years

30k-40k for marriage in the next 2 years

Currently saving 4k a month 

I was thinking of investion at least 40k into twitter/facebook after the recent crash (especially Facebook since I have a lot of faith in it) maybe 10k and 20k and putting the rest into a ETF fund such as SPY and keeping only 20k in online high yield saving account.

370,Leaving my internship 3 weeks early - How can I do so without burning bridges?,"Long story short, the internship was great in me being able to learn about how the business works, network with various people, make some good friends but I am just tired. 

Due to a huge change in regulations, interns cannot touch or even come close to any work involving client information and as my department deals with all client information, I have not touched a single piece of real work for the past 7 weeks. Essentially what I have been doing is chatting with various teams and self studying but I am getting tired with all this and don’t think I’m spending my summer well by being here. I have received another offer for another internship in another industry (legal) which I plan on doing after I leave

The only “real” piece of work I had is a presentation I am doing with a group which is going to be done by today and I plan on leaving after it is over so I don’t leave anyone with any extra burdens but apart from this what is the best way to leave?

404,Hedging with derivatives - some simple questions (assignment..),"Hi all,

I have two scenarios that needs to be appropriately hedged using derivative instruments (some school task i have to complete). 

Case 1:

A mortgage bank would like to offer a 10-year fixed mortgage rate of 2.5% to its customers. Its main business is to take short term deposits from retail investors and offer long-term mortgages. 

The hedging solution has to be based on a interest rate swap. As i see it, the bank should swap, so that it receives fixed interest rate and pays based on the current floating rate. 

Case 2: 

A US based company knows it will receive a future payment in £GBP. The payment will be received in 5 months.

The hedge must be based on futures contract. As i see it, the company should sell USD/GBP futures (equivalent in value to the future GBP payment) in order to lock in the price and hedge for volatility. 

Please correct me if my assumptions and solution are incorrect. This is for a school assignment, and i have little experience in risk management and hedging in general. This is a general assignment, and they are looking for general understanding of the different concepts.

Thanks a bunch!",finance,1533115898,eklitz,93nhmj,0,1,True,2018-08-01

6,How to Not Suck at Investing,"Most investors who start out make some BIG mistakes that cause them to lose lots of money, get frustrated, and then quit.

The problem with this is investing is truly a life-long game. You should always think of your investments as a work in progress rather than a finished product. 

I got into investing at 13 via stock market simulations where I would type various tickers into the site [www.bigcharts.com](https://www.bigcharts.com) and look for companies that had a ""strong buy"" rating by analysts. Surprisingly, this strategy did quite well. I remember taking 5th place in a state wide stock market competition (in Wisconsin - middle of corn fields ; 0) and that really sparked my passion for investing. 

When I landed my first internship I was taking my money and betting on stocks purely off charts and recommendations from colleagues. We bought exciting high-risk and high-reward stocks that ended up only sinking. We fell into the common trap that beginning investors face. 

We wanted to take $100 and turn it into thousands saying to ourselves, ""we don't care about the risk - just give me return."" 

This is the WRONG way to invest. 14 years later, I've finished a finance/accounting degree and have been trading/investing along the way. 

I've came to one simple conclusion. Good businesses over-time will make you money. Sure, these businesses can be cyclical and related to the macroeconomic environment, but a strong business will beat inflation and if you continue to invest in good businesses, at some point you will look at your portfolio with a smile. 

The market is filled with NOISE. This is good for brokerages which make a commission based on the market buzz and people trading in and out of securities. Media companies love to generate a buzz too so they can generate traffic on a daily basis even if nothing significant has happened. 

I've found there are three metrics that you can look at as a starting point to identify if a stock is a worth investment or not. All of these metrics you can view for FREE on [Morningstar.com](https://Morningstar.com).  Type in a ticker symbol at the top - let's use a great business Sherwin-Williams (SHW) to start. Once you search the ticker, click **Operating Performance** and look at the Operating Margin (or return on sales), look at the free cash flow as a % of revenue (you need to manually calculate this), and look at the return on invested capital. All three of these metrics should be 10% or higher. 

This extremely simple step in many cases will cause you to avoid making some HUGE investment mistakes and stick businesses that are actually generating a decent profit, generating cash flow, and continuing to invest profitably. 

After this point of course I would research the business further, look at competitive advantages, look at the valuations, analyze the balance sheet to make sure debt / liabilities aren't out of whack, and then make sure that I understand the future growth vectors of the company. 

Facebook (FB) is a great business because it is growing like a weed and generating huge cash flow! You can't find many companies with that growth in sales and in cash. They have a wide-moat in the social media space and report earnings today - whether the report causes the stock up or down in the short-run, I think it's an obvious growth stock today. 

Look for companies with climbing operating performance and a business model you understand and you will be successful. If you want to learn more you can check out a site my friend and I started since we have been investment geeks. [www.robinhoodstrategy.com](https://www.robinhoodstrategy.com)

I’ve heard this is “industry standard” but I’d like if someone could actually explain why. 
Example: I work with a collections vendor. When we determine their liquidation rate, we compare an average of their placements from the last twelve months to how much they collected that month. So if they receive $10K every month, their average is $10K. But they don’t collect on all of the dollars placed with them, so their total inventory for last month is $25K. Why would I compare last month’s collections to the $10K average instead of the $25K they actually have in their inventory?

21,Middle Market Lending vs International Trade Finance,"I currently work as a middle market credit analyst and am on the commerical lender track. I was recently approached about taking an internal job in our International Trade Finance group. What do you guys think? 

It’s common for people to hop around internally, but typically people start out with a few years in middle market lending before they start working in the smaller business lines. My concern is that I may get passed over for something down the line because I don’t have that experience. That being said, they are wanting to hire me with succession planning in mind as several people in the group are close to retirement. I think I would have a clear shot to SVP in ~7-12 years and not much competition for department head. The tradeoff being that I would probably not have as much internal mobility and would have to catch a lucky break to progress much beyond that point. 

I’d appreciate any thoughts/guidance. ",finance,1532558461,dreadfulevill,91wn1c,1,1,True,2018-07-25

This is in accordance to the literature and it is called the low volatility anomaly, that low volatility stocks outperform throughout the time the high volatility stocks. However for the groups formed based on beta i see that the high risk group outperforms the low risk group.

So, with Direct Listings, I'm still a bit confused as to how the company determines what to price shares at? Wouldn't they still need help from some intermediary to decide what a fair market price would be?

Also, with IPOs, my understanding is that you pay for two things. 1) Help with Publicizing IPO/Pricing 2) Risk that the bank takes on when they quote the company a set price.

So, what if you just wanted help with step 1, but you'd take the bank's price for your stock and then sell a % of your company at that price (to fundraise) without relying on the bank to take the risk?

My girlfriend currently works as a nurse's aid making 11.50$ an hour, 30 hours a week. We have $3000 to our name, a 2012 reliable honda civic and a 2004 ""beater"" honda civic. We have about 2 months left at our current apartment, and we did have plans to move across country away from family but unsure about that route anymore.

89,"Young adult who hasn’t paid taxes, who works abroad in an unconventional industry","/asking for a friend/

She’s paid taxes the first year of her employment when she was 19- her parents listed her as dependent for their advantage even though she was not. She didn’t file her taxes for 4 years since.

Her job is as an international model. She also has had voice acting work abroad. Some of her jobs with big American brands/clients withheld a big portion (disproportionately ) for taxes for her but often not. And she hasn’t worked or lived in the u.S for the last 3 years, and in some countries she worked in such as italy- took taxes because she didn’t have a current tax return  for proof of paying the u.s.

Because of the nature of her job, she isn’t even sure what her annual income is &amp; it varies. Probably somewhere between 25-45k. She doesn’t have any debt besides the mess of this theoretically.

She is also under the impression, because nobody actually has an address on her there’s really no way for anyone to come knocking about this issue, and because she also assumes some of her agencies don’t actually report her earned monies back to the u.s -and because she doesn’t make an impressionable amount of money that it would be a lot more effort than it’s worth for anyone to come knocking about it. 

she also doesn’t think she will be settling in the U.S where she’s from long term. She also doesn’t understand why her taxes don’t fund these like healthcare or better affordable education in the u.s unlike other European countries or canada. These are all excuses or rationale as not to take the warning from her parents or significant other seriously.  She is also convinced the u.s government is corrupt and doesn’t use the tax money for the genuine benefit of the people. 

She tends to say she will hire someone to sort it out and deal with it once/if she was earning enough money it may be more of a severe stress and injustice. 

Frankly I can’t imagine how they would actually find her and enforce it, she never has problems with her working visas, sponsorships, or airport trips to or from any country including the u.s-

Maybe it would come up when she’s applying for citizenship or spousal visa abroad? Or if she were to be hired for a more typical 9-5 sort of profession in the future it would come up? 

I am mostly curious about the process that would be carried out then what scary rhetoric I should relay to her to get her to sort it out, as she is a natural rebel, something like this she has to do on her own accord or she’ll just try to prove she can get away with it.

121,Topl Protocol - Roles in Investment Process,"Topl protocol makes it possible for emerging and frontier markets to have access to investment capital necessary for an economy to thrive and for investors to accessing premier opportunities.

In the subsequent three examples of Topl's investment process, it should hopefully be clear which roles are strictly necessary and which may come and go depending on the specifics of an investment. These three examples, covering organic agriculture (blue-green), energy (orange), and infrastructure (purple), will be interspersed with each other by stage.


Roles in Investment:-
Step 1: Sourcing and On-boarding:
The first step of the process is the on-boarding of a venture by its local Hub to the platform and its subsequent risk assessment.
In Colombia, there is a farmer cooperative interested in expanding its production of organic coffee through mechanization. The cooperative believes that with the necessary investment of 85 million Colombian pesos it can produce 20,000 kg of organic coffee using its 20 hectares of land over the next year. The cooperative is contacted by the local hub (or vice versa) and the two parties publish the cooperative's proposal to the Topl platform, together with any signed supporting documents such as land titles, financial records, etc.
In South Africa, there is a new utility company looking to build an onshore wind farm with a 30 MW capacity and an average production level of 30%. They estimate that the total investment they will need is 800 million Rand. The utility company is contacted by the local hub (or vice versa) and the two parties publish the company's proposal to the Topl platform, together with any signed supporting document, such as permits, allowances for land usage, financial records, etc.
In Vietnam, two cities wish to be connected by a new bridge over a river separating them. The plan they propose will cost 30 billion Vietnamese dongs, but be viable because of the 6 billion dongs that the bridge can collect in tolls each year. The two cities are contacted by the local hub (or vice versa) and they publish the proposal to the Topl platform, together with supporting documents, such as any feasibility studies conducted.


Step 2a: Risk Assessment:
Once a venture has been on-boarded and published to the Topl platform, it is risk assessed to allow investors to make an informed decision regarding whether or not they wish to participate and at what terms. This step is handled via Topl's Divine Projection Markets. The Divine system utilizes a collection of prediction markets whereby Arbiters can submit projections regarding what they expect the outcome of a venture to be. The Divine system will be further elaborated in a subsequent section.
Arbiters believe that the venture is likely to be successful. On average, those Arbiters making projections, estimate that the cooperative will reach 90% of their target (18,000 kg) over the next year. Additionally, those Arbiters participating in the market for the Colombian economy estimate that GDP growth will stay stable over the term.
Arbiters believe that the wind farm will be successful and expect it to reach its target level of production. Additionally, those Arbiters participating in the market for the South African economy estimate that GDP growth will only grow by 1.5% per year on average over the project's operational life.
Arbiters believe that the estimates provided by the city are accurate. On average they expect the tolls collected in each of the first 10 years to exactly match those provided. Additionally, those Arbiters participating in the market for the Vietnamese economy estimate that GDP growth will increase to an average of 6.5% per year over the next five years.


Step 2b: Impact Credit Assessment:
At the same time a venture is being evaluated by Arbiters, another party, known as an Impact Credit Issuer will be evaluating the project for its potential impact. These organizations are responsible for determining the type and level of impact that a given venture is likely to have. Once making this determination, it is up to them to issue what are known as Impact Credits, tokenized representations of a particular impact.
The UN Mission in Colombia visits the cooperative and determines that this venture is happening in a region that is vulnerable to guerrilla activity and prone to coca production. As such, the mission determines that there is a connection between the successful cultivation of this land and the ongoing Colombian peace process since any land legitimately producing coffee is not being used by guerrillas or cartels to produce coca. Therefore, they state that this venture should receive up to 30 Peace Credits, 10 for the starting of the project and 1 for each successful hectare of production.
Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA), an organization with a vested interest in promoting clean energy, meets with the energy company. They state that they will issue 1 Wind Credit for each MW-h produced. 
While this venture provides for better economic collaboration between two previously unconnected cities and therefore is likely to strengthen both economies and provide new sources of employment, it does not provide any impact that an issuer is interested in at the moment.


Step 3: Contract Negotiation and Terms:
Now that our ventures have been risk assessed, they are ready to receive investment. At this time, economically motivated investors can use the supporting documents provided along with the analysis provided by Arbiters to make a decision regarding their investment. Investors can act either as individuals, as managed funds, or as a crowd to make investments. Once all parties agree to common terms, the Investment Contract will be signed and initial funds transferred. The following three tables represent some terms that the parties in each of our three examples may come to agree on.


Step 4: Contract Execution:
After all parties have agreed to common terms, the Investment Contract can be signed and begin to be executed.


Step 5: Impact Value Extraction:
As we have seen so far, Impact Credits are the tokenziation of an impact, representing some measured positive outcome of a venture. Beyond simply serving as a convenient representation for tracking or measuring outcomes, Impact Credits serve as a link between economically and socially motivated investors. Specifically, their role is to allow for exchange between these two sources of capital, with Economic Investors trading the outcomes they supported to Impact Investors in exchange for money. Turning to our two examples from above involving Impact Credits we can see exactly how this process functions.",finance,1532382450,Enidlareg,91bc2h,0,1,True,2018-07-23

399,How to Not Suck at Investing,"Most investors who start out make some BIG mistakes that cause them to lose lots of money, get frustrated, and then quit.

The problem with this is investing is truly a life-long game. You should always think of your investments as a work in progress rather than a finished product. 

I got into investing at 13 via stock market simulations where I would type various tickers into the site [www.bigcharts.com](https://www.bigcharts.com) and look for companies that had a ""strong buy"" rating by analysts. Surprisingly, this strategy did quite well. I remember taking 5th place in a state wide stock market competition (in Wisconsin - middle of corn fields ; 0) and that really sparked my passion for investing. 

When I landed my first internship I was taking my money and betting on stocks purely off charts and recommendations from colleagues. We bought exciting high-risk and high-reward stocks that ended up only sinking. We fell into the common trap that beginning investors face. 

We wanted to take $100 and turn it into thousands saying to ourselves, ""we don't care about the risk - just give me return."" 

This is the WRONG way to invest. 14 years later, I've finished a finance/accounting degree and have been trading/investing along the way. 

I've came to one simple conclusion. Good businesses over-time will make you money. Sure, these businesses can be cyclical and related to the macroeconomic environment, but a strong business will beat inflation and if you continue to invest in good businesses, at some point you will look at your portfolio with a smile. 

The market is filled with NOISE. This is good for brokerages which make a commission based on the market buzz and people trading in and out of securities. Media companies love to generate a buzz too so they can generate traffic on a daily basis even if nothing significant has happened. 

I've found there are three metrics that you can look at as a starting point to identify if a stock is a worth investment or not. All of these metrics you can view for FREE on [Morningstar.com](https://Morningstar.com).  Type in a ticker symbol at the top - let's use a great business Sherwin-Williams (SHW) to start. Once you search the ticker, click **Operating Performance** and look at the Operating Margin (or return on sales), look at the free cash flow as a % of revenue (you need to manually calculate this), and look at the return on invested capital. All three of these metrics should be 10% or higher. 

This extremely simple step in many cases will cause you to avoid making some HUGE investment mistakes and stick businesses that are actually generating a decent profit, generating cash flow, and continuing to invest profitably. 

After this point of course I would research the business further, look at competitive advantages, look at the valuations, analyze the balance sheet to make sure debt / liabilities aren't out of whack, and then make sure that I understand the future growth vectors of the company. 

Facebook (FB) is a great business because it is growing like a weed and generating huge cash flow! You can't find many companies with that growth in sales and in cash. They have a wide-moat in the social media space and report earnings today - whether the report causes the stock up or down in the short-run, I think it's an obvious growth stock today. 

Look for companies with climbing operating performance and a business model you understand and you will be successful. If you want to learn more you can check out a site my friend and I started since we have been investment geeks. [www.robinhoodstrategy.com](https://www.robinhoodstrategy.com)

I’ve heard this is “industry standard” but I’d like if someone could actually explain why. 
Example: I work with a collections vendor. When we determine their liquidation rate, we compare an average of their placements from the last twelve months to how much they collected that month. So if they receive $10K every month, their average is $10K. But they don’t collect on all of the dollars placed with them, so their total inventory for last month is $25K. Why would I compare last month’s collections to the $10K average instead of the $25K they actually have in their inventory?

It’s common for people to hop around internally, but typically people start out with a few years in middle market lending before they start working in the smaller business lines. My concern is that I may get passed over for something down the line because I don’t have that experience. That being said, they are wanting to hire me with succession planning in mind as several people in the group are close to retirement. I think I would have a clear shot to SVP in ~7-12 years and not much competition for department head. The tradeoff being that I would probably not have as much internal mobility and would have to catch a lucky break to progress much beyond that point.

At retail now but want to go to hospital where higher pay is in the next 2-5 years. Already started retirement (401K) and soon opening a ROTH IRA. I follow Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace plan and it has been the biggest blessing. We are debt free in 2 months from today. Currently living rent-free on family's property but we want to move to a neighboring state where the weather is cooler in the mountains. 

Our home budget is looking like $120K maximum for a 3 bed/2 bath. Our plan is to save for 14-16 months to put 20% down to avoid PMI and the payment would be around $750/month. our budget will have $1,200 left each month after ALL expenses EXCEPT mortgage.

My wife hates her job and she has been there 4 years and I really want her to quit so we can have kids and she can run her own business at home while I work as a Pharm Tech and expand my career and get my income up.

24,Growing up poor AF is turning out to be the best thing for me,"I just read a story that went front page about some idiot that stacked up 400k in student loans and it really made me reflect on how my entire life I was always envious of my rich friends. I have always understood the value of a dollar and shaped my finances around that and my experiences of not having any money. 

I went to community college on the governments dime. Then stacked up minimal debt (30k) going to finish off my bachelors. I have since paid that debt off, worked up the latter, first as intern and now Engineer, making 6 figures. I own a small house, bought as a foreclosure, fixed up and thinking of renting it out while I fix up another foreclosure. 

My question is how does this even happen and what is the thought process of getting that far in debt fulling understanding the end result before even making these bad decisions. Public education failed so many. Bad parenting and bad decisions is putting people in such serious predicaments. I could never imagine being weighed down by that mountain of debt.

166,Where are we headed with Derivatives ?,"https://i.redd.it/dfq5u97i45b11.jpg

**Derivatives. Not the ones you learned about in calculus, but Financial Derivatives, though the latter term is derived from the former. Considered to be one of the greatest innovations in the financial world, but still one of the most difficult concepts to understand. Simply put, a derivative is a securitised contract whose value is derived from the value of another underlying asset or security. Hence the name ""Derivative” That being said, you can essentially create an infinite form of contracts with various agreements on just a finite number of assets. But to what extent can they really grow? Have they reached their peak? Where exactly are we headed towards in the world of derivatives?**

**For most of history where derivatives existed, they were unknown to the average Joe outside the world of Finance. Not until the 2008 financial crisis, did they really began to make headlines. The term Mortgage backed securities (MBS) might ring a bell. An MBS is a security that is made up of mortgage contracts as its underlying asset. The MBS’ are then traded as fixed income securities. That's where the derivatives side kicks in. Using financial engineering, you are able to repackage mortgages into tranches with various risk levels. The following MBS’s could then be mixed up to form a Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO), which could be packaged into Synthetic CDO’s, which could be further packed into Mini Bonds, which could be packed into…. You get the idea. Point is, Financial Institutions (FI’s) are able to create the ultimate mortgage inception using derivatives. All until the housing bubble popped, and as the underlying assets depreciated in value, so did the multifold value derivatives that crashed with them. Banks went down, savings went down, businesses went down — all as collateral damage.**

**So why do these same derivatives exist? And why do they keep getting more complex, and why do more kind of derivatives keep showing up every other day? A look into the current market shows us the notional value of all derivative contracts is estimated to be around 542.4 trillion, but that figure itself is debatable, the actual market value of derivatives has a huge spread against the notional value. Basically, It's a huge market, and for a reason.**

**Derivatives exist because of demand for a specific kind of asset. A key use of derivatives is to hedge against risk. The use of futures and options contracts allow traders to hedge against future volatility in prices, and with different risk appetites different contracts can be developed. Swaps act as insurance on failure of other assets. Credit derivatives allow the flow of lending to continue while keeping investors risk appetite in check. If anything, derivatives add value to society, by making money more liquid, allowing firms/businesses/households to borrow at adequate costs, and invest in capital expenditure, growing economies in the long run. Hence, the key reason why derivatives exist.**

**Looking more into the future, some may say that derivatives have reached their peak of growth; contracts just cannot grow further from their underlying assets. Whereas, some might think otherwise. Then, there are those that feel the emerging markets (EMs) are the future to derivatives.**

**EMs are obviously on everyone's minds when trying to understand where the future of markets is headed. With strong upside potential, more and more funds managers and FIs are considering covering the underdog market. In my opinion, derivatives still have a long way to go to be fully applied in EMs. First of all, there just isn't enough volume within EMs, with fewer market makers present in most EMs compared with more developed markets. This adds on to the difficulty in creating a functioning derivatives market. Moreover, currencies of EMs can be heavily manipulated by hedge funds; take Thailand or Indonesia for example. The multiplier effect on derivatives can further aggregate fluctuations in price sourced from currency effects and increase risk of such derivatives. These countries have made increasing regulatory restrictions since, further restricting the growth of currency derivatives within their economies. Lastly, these isn’t enough short term volatility within most EMs, limiting trades to longer Holding Periods.**

**Compared to a developed market where prime brokers can provide services that include order adjustments, and discounts, and volume to trade on, EMs just do not have a lot of the infrastructure in place to accommodate a large derivatives market. Hence my view on why its is still a long time span for us to observe a transcendence of derivative into EMs.**

**Where I really see derivatives going is the quantitative side of the market - into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here derivative contracts can be priced and traded on exchanges using nothing but robots. AI usage has already begun to grow within the derivatives market, and could grow further to create an even more efficient market that can quantify deal sizes and automate the market-making methodology.**

**In more developed markets, such as Hong Kong and the US, the efficient market hypothesis stands in the way of fundamentals. Meaning that most assets are already priced at their efficient or fair value that the market perceives them to be at. That being said, it’s no surprise that most FI’s are looking to further develop their quant trading desks.**

**There truly is no correct way to estimate to what extent a derivative market can grow They can however, change. Markets adjust all the time, and lean towards supply and demand metrics, as well as regulations. Anything can be created or adjusted to meet demand; this is essentially the purpose of derivatives, and the philosophy of financial markets. Warren Buffet once said that “derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction” — they have the ability to wreak havoc on the market, but also give those that know how to use them properly an immense amount of power. They will adapt to any nature of the market, for as long as there is risk to be hedged or leverage to be made, they will find a way.**

317,My girlfriend and I are pregnant.,"I am 22 with a Computer Science degree, and my lovely girlfriend is 21. I currently am working as an IT Technician (been employeed for 7 months) at a rate of 15$ an hour, 40 hours a week. My girlfriend currently works as a nurse's aid making 11.50$ an hour, 30 hours a week. We have $3000 to our name, a 2012 reliable honda civic and a 2004 ""beater"" honda civic. We have about 2 months left at our current apartment, and we did have plans to move across country away from family but unsure about that route anymore. We think it may be best to stay close to family during this time. It is important to also note my student loan payments will begin in December which i would say are roughly 1000$ a month. 

I have roughly a credit score of 750, with a 3,500$ discover card. She has a credit score of 580 with a $250 victoria secret credit card. She is interested in attending a 500-hour program for holistic medicine and herbalism for roughly 3,700$. However the school is across country away from family. I have approximately 1 year of bartending experience and have working in restaurants for about 5 years. She also has around 5 years of resturant experience. I mention this because we both made more money working in restaurants but were unhappy and needed change. I need to know how i can best make us finicaially stable so we can raise a child without concerns about our finances.

On the check I received I got 760 dollars. That may sound great but I had 750 hours of vacation time. So essentially I got a little over a dollar an hour for those hours. Is this something that is totally legal to do? Can I do anything about it? If I had taken the time off before this it would have been over 5000 dollars take home easily. And over a free month of working 24 hours a day 5 days a week. Thank you for any information you can provide.

345,"Young adult who hasn’t paid taxes, who works abroad in an unconventional industry","/asking for a friend/

She’s paid taxes the first year of her employment when she was 19- her parents listed her as dependent for their advantage even though she was not. She didn’t file her taxes for 4 years since.

Her job is as an international model. She also has had voice acting work abroad. Some of her jobs with big American brands/clients withheld a big portion (disproportionately ) for taxes for her but often not. And she hasn’t worked or lived in the u.S for the last 3 years, and in some countries she worked in such as italy- took taxes because she didn’t have a current tax return  for proof of paying the u.s.

Because of the nature of her job, she isn’t even sure what her annual income is &amp; it varies. Probably somewhere between 25-45k. She doesn’t have any debt besides the mess of this theoretically.

She is also under the impression, because nobody actually has an address on her there’s really no way for anyone to come knocking about this issue, and because she also assumes some of her agencies don’t actually report her earned monies back to the u.s -and because she doesn’t make an impressionable amount of money that it would be a lot more effort than it’s worth for anyone to come knocking about it. 

she also doesn’t think she will be settling in the U.S where she’s from long term. She also doesn’t understand why her taxes don’t fund these like healthcare or better affordable education in the u.s unlike other European countries or canada. These are all excuses or rationale as not to take the warning from her parents or significant other seriously.  She is also convinced the u.s government is corrupt and doesn’t use the tax money for the genuine benefit of the people. 

She tends to say she will hire someone to sort it out and deal with it once/if she was earning enough money it may be more of a severe stress and injustice. 

Frankly I can’t imagine how they would actually find her and enforce it, she never has problems with her working visas, sponsorships, or airport trips to or from any country including the u.s-

Maybe it would come up when she’s applying for citizenship or spousal visa abroad? Or if she were to be hired for a more typical 9-5 sort of profession in the future it would come up? 

I am mostly curious about the process that would be carried out then what scary rhetoric I should relay to her to get her to sort it out, as she is a natural rebel, something like this she has to do on her own accord or she’ll just try to prove she can get away with it.

377,Topl Protocol - Roles in Investment Process,"Topl protocol makes it possible for emerging and frontier markets to have access to investment capital necessary for an economy to thrive and for investors to accessing premier opportunities.

In the subsequent three examples of Topl's investment process, it should hopefully be clear which roles are strictly necessary and which may come and go depending on the specifics of an investment. These three examples, covering organic agriculture (blue-green), energy (orange), and infrastructure (purple), will be interspersed with each other by stage.


Roles in Investment:-
Step 1: Sourcing and On-boarding:
The first step of the process is the on-boarding of a venture by its local Hub to the platform and its subsequent risk assessment.
In Colombia, there is a farmer cooperative interested in expanding its production of organic coffee through mechanization. The cooperative believes that with the necessary investment of 85 million Colombian pesos it can produce 20,000 kg of organic coffee using its 20 hectares of land over the next year. The cooperative is contacted by the local hub (or vice versa) and the two parties publish the cooperative's proposal to the Topl platform, together with any signed supporting documents such as land titles, financial records, etc.
In South Africa, there is a new utility company looking to build an onshore wind farm with a 30 MW capacity and an average production level of 30%. They estimate that the total investment they will need is 800 million Rand. The utility company is contacted by the local hub (or vice versa) and the two parties publish the company's proposal to the Topl platform, together with any signed supporting document, such as permits, allowances for land usage, financial records, etc.
In Vietnam, two cities wish to be connected by a new bridge over a river separating them. The plan they propose will cost 30 billion Vietnamese dongs, but be viable because of the 6 billion dongs that the bridge can collect in tolls each year. The two cities are contacted by the local hub (or vice versa) and they publish the proposal to the Topl platform, together with supporting documents, such as any feasibility studies conducted.


Step 2a: Risk Assessment:
Once a venture has been on-boarded and published to the Topl platform, it is risk assessed to allow investors to make an informed decision regarding whether or not they wish to participate and at what terms. This step is handled via Topl's Divine Projection Markets. The Divine system utilizes a collection of prediction markets whereby Arbiters can submit projections regarding what they expect the outcome of a venture to be. The Divine system will be further elaborated in a subsequent section.
Arbiters believe that the venture is likely to be successful. On average, those Arbiters making projections, estimate that the cooperative will reach 90% of their target (18,000 kg) over the next year. Additionally, those Arbiters participating in the market for the Colombian economy estimate that GDP growth will stay stable over the term.
Arbiters believe that the wind farm will be successful and expect it to reach its target level of production. Additionally, those Arbiters participating in the market for the South African economy estimate that GDP growth will only grow by 1.5% per year on average over the project's operational life.
Arbiters believe that the estimates provided by the city are accurate. On average they expect the tolls collected in each of the first 10 years to exactly match those provided. Additionally, those Arbiters participating in the market for the Vietnamese economy estimate that GDP growth will increase to an average of 6.5% per year over the next five years.


Step 2b: Impact Credit Assessment:
At the same time a venture is being evaluated by Arbiters, another party, known as an Impact Credit Issuer will be evaluating the project for its potential impact. These organizations are responsible for determining the type and level of impact that a given venture is likely to have. Once making this determination, it is up to them to issue what are known as Impact Credits, tokenized representations of a particular impact.
The UN Mission in Colombia visits the cooperative and determines that this venture is happening in a region that is vulnerable to guerrilla activity and prone to coca production. As such, the mission determines that there is a connection between the successful cultivation of this land and the ongoing Colombian peace process since any land legitimately producing coffee is not being used by guerrillas or cartels to produce coca. Therefore, they state that this venture should receive up to 30 Peace Credits, 10 for the starting of the project and 1 for each successful hectare of production.
Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA), an organization with a vested interest in promoting clean energy, meets with the energy company. They state that they will issue 1 Wind Credit for each MW-h produced. 
While this venture provides for better economic collaboration between two previously unconnected cities and therefore is likely to strengthen both economies and provide new sources of employment, it does not provide any impact that an issuer is interested in at the moment.


Step 3: Contract Negotiation and Terms:
Now that our ventures have been risk assessed, they are ready to receive investment. At this time, economically motivated investors can use the supporting documents provided along with the analysis provided by Arbiters to make a decision regarding their investment. Investors can act either as individuals, as managed funds, or as a crowd to make investments. Once all parties agree to common terms, the Investment Contract will be signed and initial funds transferred. The following three tables represent some terms that the parties in each of our three examples may come to agree on.


Step 4: Contract Execution:
After all parties have agreed to common terms, the Investment Contract can be signed and begin to be executed.


Step 5: Impact Value Extraction:
As we have seen so far, Impact Credits are the tokenziation of an impact, representing some measured positive outcome of a venture. Beyond simply serving as a convenient representation for tracking or measuring outcomes, Impact Credits serve as a link between economically and socially motivated investors. Specifically, their role is to allow for exchange between these two sources of capital, with Economic Investors trading the outcomes they supported to Impact Investors in exchange for money. Turning to our two examples from above involving Impact Credits we can see exactly how this process functions.",finance,1532382450,Enidlareg,91bc2h,0,1,True,2018-07-23

I made a throwaway account for this in the hopes that maybe some of you on here could point me in the right direction regarding how to handle my finances moving forward.

Some basic info -

I'm 27 years old and I have $125,000 saved up in the bank. I'm not entirely sure what I should be doing with this money, where to invest it, how to make it work for me, etc. It's basically my fall back in case anything in my life goes awry.

I'm an actor, so work can be very inconsistent, so I was hoping to use the money in a way to somehow create some form of security in an investment in some way. I'm not entirely sure.

At the moment, I'm fortunate enough to live rent free - I live in an apartment on the first floor of my family house. We also own the house next door and rent it out for $2,500 a month before taxes and utilities. My mother and I split this, there's no other family members in the picture.

If life fucked me, we could sell the house next door that we're renting out and likely get around $800,000 for it, but I'd prefer we hang onto it and let the property value increase while we collect rent off of it. I'd also want to turn the first floor of that second house into an apartment to rent out too to make a few more hundred.

What do you guys think? Any ideas? I need some fresh eyes on my situation.

30,Looking for analysis on a infographic,"Here is said [infographic](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/).  


The data is a bit out of date, but still delivers on its promise: to help us visualize the size of different types of money. I personally have two question clusters regarding the data:  


1) Debt reached incredibly high levels (325% of global GDP!) and keeps climbing (a third was added in the last decade!).  Clearly we (the US) is still a long way from defaulting, but the we're already spending $263 billion on interest payments. While this is less than 7% of total US's total spending, it is an uncomfortably large number IMHO. Are there any examples of modern developed economies with 25%, 50%, or 75% of their expenditures spent on interest payments? Just how big a threat to growth &amp; the current world order are the rising levels of debt?  


2) Why is the derivative market so much larger than anything else? I'm familiar with derivatives in theory and understand that they can lead to enormous profits if leverage is used correctly. Despite that, I just can't see how the derivative market is worth as much or more than every class of money. That seems ludicrous to me.

And it gave me back only $4000. It’s 9PM now and I can’t reach any via their ATM phone line.

I’m just in shock right now because I’m 100% sure I put in $5000. I had split it from a fresh $10k stack that still had the tape on it.

I’m going to go in the branch tomorrow, but I don’t know what price I have besides my word, and maybe they could pull up the camera, but I’m not sure how that’s going to help.

I kind of snatched the card away from him and he was joking around about having it. Tbh, he's a good guy and i helped him stop drinking. He also went homeless and his family tries to keep him out of the house (except his mom, she is my friend as well.) because he believes he is being gangstalked.  Albeit, i do not trust the meth he used, he is actually very religious now and just got a job. I am kind of losing sleep over this as i am in a dark place myself (just stopped smoking, using drugs to cope with stress). This guy kind of knows where i live, my phone number, my middle name, and a lot of stuff about me. I confronted him about this and he says hes sorry,but he thinks im overthinking stuff like hes going to use my identity and shit. He is my friend though as he has helped me get out of dark times. He even offered to take a picture of HIS social security card and send it to me because he says he trusts me, but i said no. I just want to see your card.

I made an account with equifax and locked my account for now. Is there anything else i should do?

411,It’s time to beat the market,"It is all about studies and research when it comes to being a good investor or trader. There are too many parameters to fit into one blog that might help you understand and analyze the market. Even after years of research, you will still have topics left to learn. 

After spending a lot of time and money on research, investment analysts and advisers are always looking for strategies which will outperform the market sentiments at any given period of time. Most of the sectors failed to outperform the [S&amp;P500 index's performance](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/si_performance.jhtml?tab=siperformance) except for Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Financials, and Information Technology sector. 

*Processing img v2k8p0oi7wa11...*

So, if the experts and fund managers cannot beat the market sentiments, what are the odds of us beating the market? 

Well, even when things seem to go south, there are a few investment techniques backed by research and also time-tested which tends to outperform the market sentiments. They might prove to be a good investment and generate consistent incomes. 

1. [Stocks paying dividends](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/sp500-highest-dividend-yield) tend to outperform the market: A study by Ned Davis Research found that dividend-paying stocks tend to give better returns and beat the market sentiment over a longer period of time than stocks who don't pay dividends. 

Stocks in S&amp;P500 that did not pay dividends gave a 2.5% annual return from 1972 through 2015 whereas a dividend-paying stock gained 7.4% annually. 

2. Stocks buy-back plans also tend to outperform: Companies that repurchase their own shares generally generates higher returns. As a company buys back its own shares the outstanding shares goes down resulting in an increase in a value of its own shares even if there is not enough income. 

On May 1, Apple announced a buy-back program to repurchase stocks worth $100 billion. The stock price was $169.10 during close on that day and the prices surged by 10.02% to $186.05 within a week and were up by 12.59% by the last trading day. 

https://i.redd.it/1mh3skmf7wa11.png

3. Buy and Hold strategy: Research shows that buying a stock and holding it for a longer stretch of time is one of the best ways to make money in the long run as well as it is a low-risk strategy. An Oppenheimer study shows that S&amp;P500 never lost in the long run over a 20 year period of time back till 1950 whereas lost 16 times in the short run. 

A research by Morningstar shows that if any person invested in any in 30 of the biggest rallied days in the stock market, he would have made 1/5th of the money than the person who held in throughout. 

4. Dividend Reinvestment: Dividend reinvestment will help you in the compound growth. When you reinvest your dividend to buy more shares, you eventually end up owning more shares that will generate more dividends. 

I’m not some investment mogul or expert, but someone just like you. Even though no strategies can give you guaranteed returns, these sets of strategies generally outperform the market. In short, you might try identifying companies that provide dividends and has regular buy-back plans. Hold your stock for a longer period of time and try reinvesting your dividends. Patience might give you a great reward after a long run. ",finance,1532000934,indianleo,90559h,6,1,True,2018-07-19

At retail now but want to go to hospital where higher pay is in the next 2-5 years. Already started retirement (401K) and soon opening a ROTH IRA. I follow Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace plan and it has been the biggest blessing. We are debt free in 2 months from today. Currently living rent-free on family's property but we want to move to a neighboring state where the weather is cooler in the mountains. 

Our home budget is looking like $120K maximum for a 3 bed/2 bath.

490,Growing up poor AF is turning out to be the best thing for me,"I just read a story that went front page about some idiot that stacked up 400k in student loans and it really made me reflect on how my entire life I was always envious of my rich friends. I have always understood the value of a dollar and shaped my finances around that and my experiences of not having any money. 

I went to community college on the governments dime. Then stacked up minimal debt (30k) going to finish off my bachelors. I have since paid that debt off, worked up the latter, first as intern and now Engineer, making 6 figures. I own a small house, bought as a foreclosure, fixed up and thinking of renting it out while I fix up another foreclosure. 

My question is how does this even happen and what is the thought process of getting that far in debt fulling understanding the end result before even making these bad decisions. Public education failed so many. Bad parenting and bad decisions is putting people in such serious predicaments. I could never imagine being weighed down by that mountain of debt.

26,"Help! H&amp;R Block made a mistake in my tax return and now the IRS wants $2,600.","So any advice would be great, I'll try and keep this brief.

In February I filed my taxes on H&amp;R blocks website. I was asked if I am a college student, I am. I was awarded a tax credit for being employed full time while working full time. I submitted my return and thought nothing of it.

Fast forward a few months later, I get a letter from IRS wanting proof of my student status AND a 1080 form from my  university showing my tuition payment.

Well proof of student status was easy enough, I was able to get my transcript for the year from my university, but my mother is employed at the college I attend and I am granted free tuition. So I do not have a 1080 form to send to the IRS. I said as much in my reply to the IRS. I figured the worst that could happen is they would remove the credit I received for being a student.

Fast forward 2 more months. I get a letter from the IRS and now not only did they remove the tax credit (which I was prepared for) but now I suddenly owe the IRS $2,600. I'm very confused because even before the student credit was applied I was still in the positive on my return. Why do I suddenly owe them all this money now?

I realize this may not be the correct sub to ask for help, but any advice would be appreciated. I dont know what to do.",finance,1531523704,ChaseBank5,8yoqyz,5,1,True,2018-07-13

279,Looking for some financial advice. Can anyone help me / point me in a good direction?,"Hey everyone,

I made a throwaway account for this in the hopes that maybe some of you on here could point me in the right direction regarding how to handle my finances moving forward.

Some basic info -

I'm 27 years old and I have $125,000 saved up in the bank. I'm not entirely sure what I should be doing with this money, where to invest it, how to make it work for me, etc. It's basically my fall back in case anything in my life goes awry.

I'm an actor, so work can be very inconsistent, so I was hoping to use the money in a way to somehow create some form of security in an investment in some way. I'm not entirely sure.

At the moment, I'm fortunate enough to live rent free - I live in an apartment on the first floor of my family house. We also own the house next door and rent it out for $2,500 a month before taxes and utilities. My mother and I split this, there's no other family members in the picture.

If life fucked me, we could sell the house next door that we're renting out and likely get around $800,000 for it, but I'd prefer we hang onto it and let the property value increase while we collect rent off of it. I'd also want to turn the first floor of that second house into an apartment to rent out too to make a few more hundred.

What do you guys think? Any ideas? I need some fresh eyes on my situation.

Thanks very much in advance, and if you need more info, let me know.",finance,1531787021,stone_stocko,8zget8,0,1,True,2018-07-16

287,Looking for analysis on a infographic,"Here is said [infographic](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/).  


The data is a bit out of date, but still delivers on its promise: to help us visualize the size of different types of money. I personally have two question clusters regarding the data:  


1) Debt reached incredibly high levels (325% of global GDP!) and keeps climbing (a third was added in the last decade!).  Clearly we (the US) is still a long way from defaulting, but the we're already spending $263 billion on interest payments. While this is less than 7% of total US's total spending, it is an uncomfortably large number IMHO. Are there any examples of modern developed economies with 25%, 50%, or 75% of their expenditures spent on interest payments? Just how big a threat to growth &amp; the current world order are the rising levels of debt?  


2) Why is the derivative market so much larger than anything else? I'm familiar with derivatives in theory and understand that they can lead to enormous profits if leverage is used correctly. Despite that, I just can't see how the derivative market is worth as much or more than every class of money. That seems ludicrous to me. 

If y'all have any other feedback or analysis let 'er rip. ",finance,1531798749,suspectfuton,8zhshw,0,1,True,2018-07-16
290,Bank of America ATM stole $1000 from me.,"I went to the Bank of America to deposit money. It said 50 bills max and I deposited $5000. After it counted, the screen showed only $4000. I was in shock and clicked cancel to receive my cash back.

And it gave me back only $4000. It’s 9PM now and I can’t reach any via their ATM phone line.

I’m just in shock right now because I’m 100% sure I put in $5000. I had split it from a fresh $10k stack that still had the tape on it.

I’m going to go in the branch tomorrow, but I don’t know what price I have besides my word, and maybe they could pull up the camera, but I’m not sure how that’s going to help.

He also went homeless and his family tries to keep him out of the house (except his mom, she is my friend as well.) because he believes he is being gangstalked.  Albeit, i do not trust the meth he used, he is actually very religious now and just got a job. I am kind of losing sleep over this as i am in a dark place myself (just stopped smoking, using drugs to cope with stress). This guy kind of knows where i live, my phone number, my middle name, and a lot of stuff about me. I confronted him about this and he says hes sorry,but he thinks im overthinking stuff like hes going to use my identity and shit. He is my friend though as he has helped me get out of dark times. He even offered to take a picture of HIS social security card and send it to me because he says he trusts me, but i said no. I just want to see your card.

I made an account with equifax and locked my account for now. Is there anything else i should do?

Hey guys, so I'll be entering my 4th year of college in August. And with college, comes loans. Unfortunately for me, my parents screwed me over. When I took out a loan my freshman year, my father had taken care of it (stupid move) and decided to pay a fixed amount while I was in school, of 25 dollars to reduce interest. Around the the time of my second year, he stopped these payments and failed to inform me. At the time, I wasn't signed up for any credit following services such as credit karma. It took me 6 months and a collect call to ask me why  I wasn't paying my loan, and confused me signs up for credit karma. Lo and behold, my dad stopped paying wituout informing me, causing a 200 point credit drop. I've only now brought it back to where it is, out of pure luck.

The loan I require is 20k. This will cover everything for the entire year, but my parents shot their own credit through their inability to balance out credit cards. So here I am, with 1 month to get my loan and figure everything out. 

I already work full time in a psychiatric ward as a nursing aid making ~25k, which also runs its own issues with the risk of me being injured also being extremely prevalent. I'd rather not push it harder than I am. 


Any advice will be welcome, I feel extremely lost. 


TLDR: Need loan for 20k so I can graduate but not sure to do, have shit credit cuz of father and parents have no credit due to being reckless pls help.

My first question is about 401k. Some articles online have been claiming it’s a failure and I’ve been skeptical about it. The company I’m working for will match my contribution up to 6%. I understand this is a way for my income not to be taxed and to get more from the company, but I still am not sure why this is so beneficial. Basically, am I loaning the government money and hoping that I will be repaid by the time I retire? To me it seems risky to put away so much money that I can’t access for so many years. I am sorry if this sounds ignorant.

Basically everyone keeps telling me to be smart with my money management but doesn’t have good suggestions. 

If it makes a difference, my goal (unless I fall in love with this career path which I believe is unlikely) is to work for two years and then travel with whatever money I have and follow some larger passions regardless of the jobs income. For this reason, I’m not sure if I should save anything in a 401k if I’d really just like to almost “sacrifice” this two year commitment to pursue other things in the future. But I need to pursue this job for now because I have no work experience yet and I don’t want my degree to be a waste.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance,1531390118,paypaypaypay32,8y8fis,3,1,True,2018-07-12

269,Saving Money to Reach your Goals is Crazy,Peace of mind is priceless but the numbers really don’t lie. I think people are focusing too much on savings when we should be stressing investing most of our money. [But this video brought it home for me. It clearly shows that investing is the only way you will reach your financial goals and savings is probably the worst thing you can do to build wealth.] (https://youtu.be/tseffzM1A9Y)Even if you invested your money into the market at the peak before the last crash just a couple years after you got it all back. And if you left alone until today your money would have doubled. Look at a chart of the stock market. You’ll see it always crashes but it always comes back even more. In fact the stock market always goes up. Of course you should have an emergency fund but putting most your money in savings is like throwing money away; simple because you loose money in a savings account from inflation.,finance,1531400655,c7burke,8y9l3q,10,1,True,2018-07-12

However, I’m hesitant because I’m told that if I do, it’ll affect my credit score? I want to close the card as I don’t use it at all, and while it has a really high limit, it also has a really high interest rate. So what should I do? I have two other credit cards that I use with a much lower interest rate on each, and when you combine the limits of each, they’re just shy of my original card?

459,"Help! H&amp;R Block made a mistake in my tax return and now the IRS wants $2,600.","So any advice would be great, I'll try and keep this brief.

In February I filed my taxes on H&amp;R blocks website. I was asked if I am a college student, I am. I was awarded a tax credit for being employed full time while working full time. I submitted my return and thought nothing of it.

Fast forward a few months later, I get a letter from IRS wanting proof of my student status AND a 1080 form from my  university showing my tuition payment.

Well proof of student status was easy enough, I was able to get my transcript for the year from my university, but my mother is employed at the college I attend and I am granted free tuition. So I do not have a 1080 form to send to the IRS. I said as much in my reply to the IRS. I figured the worst that could happen is they would remove the credit I received for being a student.

Fast forward 2 more months. I get a letter from the IRS and now not only did they remove the tax credit (which I was prepared for) but now I suddenly owe the IRS $2,600. I'm very confused because even before the student credit was applied I was still in the positive on my return. Why do I suddenly owe them all this money now?

I realize this may not be the correct sub to ask for help, but any advice would be appreciated. I dont know what to do.",finance,1531523704,ChaseBank5,8yoqyz,5,1,True,2018-07-13
